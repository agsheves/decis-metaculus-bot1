[2025-05-15 20:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 1.5 months, as the Q2 2025 delivery report is expected around July 3, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If Rivian's Q2 2025 deliveries were similar to Q1 2025, they would deliver around 8,640 vehicles.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Rivian would need to increase their deliveries to meet their revised annual guidance. Assuming they aim to average deliveries over the remaining quarters, they would target approximately 10,000 to 12,500 vehicles for Q2 2025.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Based on the revised annual guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles, experts likely expect Rivian to deliver between 10,000 and 12,500 vehicles in Q2 2025 to stay on track.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant supply chain disruption or further regulatory challenges could severely impact Rivian's production capabilities, resulting in deliveries falling below 8,000 vehicles.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in demand, possibly driven by a successful marketing campaign or favorable market conditions, could lead to Rivian exceeding expectations and delivering over 13,000 vehicles.

[2025-05-15 20:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as Rivian is expected to report Q2 2025 vehicle deliveries around July 3, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be similar to Q1 2025, with deliveries around 8,640 vehicles, given the challenges Rivian is facing with tariffs and logistics.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would see Rivian delivering between 10,000 and 12,500 vehicles in Q2 2025, as they need to average this range per quarter to meet their revised full-year guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets are likely aligned with Rivian's revised guidance, anticipating Q2 deliveries to fall within the 10,000 to 12,500 range, assuming no further disruptions or changes in market conditions.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant supply chain disruption or further tariff increases could severely impact production and logistics, resulting in deliveries dropping to around 7,000 vehicles for Q2 2025.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in consumer demand or a breakthrough in resolving logistical challenges could lead to higher-than-expected deliveries, potentially reaching 13,000 vehicles for Q2 2025.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the need to meet the revised annual guidance, Rivian would need to deliver between 10,000 and 12,500 vehicles per quarter for the rest of the year. Therefore, if the trend continues, Q2 2025 deliveries would likely fall within this range.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts and markets likely expect Rivian to deliver between 10,000 and 12,500 vehicles in Q2 2025 to stay on track with the revised annual guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant supply chain disruption or escalation in production costs due to new tariffs could severely limit Rivian's ability to deliver vehicles, resulting in deliveries falling below 8,000 vehicles.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in consumer demand, possibly driven by a successful marketing campaign or favorable changes in trade regulations, could lead to higher-than-expected deliveries, potentially exceeding 13,000 vehicles.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If Rivian maintains its Q1 2025 delivery rate of 8,640 vehicles, Q2 2025 deliveries would also be around 8,640 vehicles.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the need to meet the revised annual guidance of 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles, Rivian would need to deliver between 10,000 and 12,500 vehicles per quarter for the remaining three quarters. Thus, if the trend of needing to increase deliveries continues, Q2 2025 deliveries could be in this range.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts likely expect Rivian to increase its deliveries in Q2 2025 to align with its revised annual guidance. This would suggest a target range of approximately 10,000 to 12,500 vehicles for Q2 2025.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant supply chain disruption or escalation in trade tariffs could severely impact Rivian's production capabilities, resulting in deliveries falling below 8,000 vehicles for Q2 2025.
