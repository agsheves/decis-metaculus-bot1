[2025-05-16 10:01:36] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-05-16 10:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 45 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 16, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question would resolve as **No**, since Sri Lanka is currently not listed as available on Starlink's availability map, and recent reports indicate that regulatory approval has been stalled.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the continuation of the current regulatory challenges in Sri Lanka. If the security and sovereignty concerns remain unresolved and the government does not grant the necessary approvals for Starlink to operate, then Sri Lanka will not appear as available on the Starlink availability map by the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a breakthrough in negotiations between Starlink and the Sri Lankan government, leading to a resolution of the security and sovereignty concerns. If the government grants the necessary approvals and Starlink quickly updates its availability map to include Sri Lanka, then the question would resolve as Yes.

Given the current situation, where significant regulatory hurdles are present and the deadline is approaching quickly, the likelihood of a Yes outcome seems low. The status quo outcome is that the regulatory issues will not be resolved in time, leading to a No outcome. However, it is important to consider the possibility of rapid changes, especially if there is political or economic pressure to improve digital inclusion in Sri Lanka.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a "No," as Sri Lanka is currently not listed as available on Starlink's availability map, and recent reports indicate that regulatory approval has been stalled due to security and sovereignty concerns.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The regulatory challenges in Sri Lanka remain unresolved, and the government continues to stall Starlink's deployment due to ongoing security and sovereignty concerns. As a result, Starlink does not list Sri Lanka as available on its availability map by the July 1, 2025 deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The Sri Lankan government and Starlink reach an agreement that addresses the security and sovereignty concerns. This leads to the lifting of the stall on Starlink's deployment, and Starlink updates its availability map to include Sri Lanka before the July 1, 2025 deadline.

Rationale: Given the current status and the recent reports indicating significant regulatory hurdles, the likelihood of a resolution in the next 45 days seems low. Regulatory processes, especially those involving security and sovereignty issues, can be complex and time-consuming. While there is a possibility of a breakthrough, the status quo suggests that the challenges may not be resolved in time. Therefore, the probability of a "No" outcome is higher.

[2025-05-16 10:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) There are approximately 45 days left until the outcome of the question is known, with the deadline being July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the question resolves as **No**. Currently, Sri Lanka is not listed as available on the Starlink availability map, and recent developments suggest that regulatory issues are impeding progress.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that the regulatory challenges in Sri Lanka remain unresolved. The security and sovereignty concerns continue to stall Starlink's deployment, and no agreement is reached between Starlink and the Sri Lankan authorities before the deadline. This would mean that Sri Lanka does not appear as available on the Starlink map by July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that the Sri Lankan government and Starlink manage to resolve the regulatory issues swiftly. This could involve negotiations that address the security and sovereignty concerns, leading to a rapid deployment of Starlink services in Sri Lanka. Consequently, Starlink updates its availability map to include Sri Lanka as an available country before the deadline.

Rationale: Given the current status and the recent reports about significant regulatory hurdles, the likelihood of a quick resolution seems low. The world tends to change slowly, and regulatory issues, especially those involving security and sovereignty, can be particularly challenging to overcome in a short time frame. Therefore, the status quo outcome of **No** is more likely, but there remains a possibility for a last-minute resolution.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as Sri Lanka is currently not listed as available on the Starlink availability map, and recent reports indicate that regulatory approval has been stalled due to security and sovereignty concerns.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the continuation of the current regulatory challenges, with Sri Lanka and Starlink unable to resolve the security and sovereignty issues before the July 1, 2025 deadline. This would mean that Starlink's services remain unavailable in Sri Lanka, and the country does not appear on the availability map.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a rapid resolution of the regulatory issues between Sri Lanka and Starlink. This could occur if both parties reach an agreement addressing the security and sovereignty concerns, allowing Starlink to proceed with its deployment and list Sri Lanka as available on the Starlink availability map before the deadline.

Rationale:
Given the current status, the regulatory challenges are significant and described as "distinct," which suggests they may not be easily or quickly resolved. The time frame of 45 days is relatively short for overcoming such hurdles, especially when they involve security and sovereignty concerns. The status quo outcome is a strong indicator of the likely result, as changes in regulatory environments often take time. Therefore, while a resolution is possible, the probability of it occurring within the remaining time frame is relatively low.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as Sri Lanka is currently not listed as available on the Starlink availability map, and recent reports indicate that regulatory approval has been stalled due to security and sovereignty concerns.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the continued inability of Starlink and the Sri Lankan government to resolve the regulatory issues related to security and sovereignty. This could mean ongoing negotiations without reaching an agreement, or the Sri Lankan government maintaining its stance against allowing Starlink's deployment due to these concerns.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Starlink and the Sri Lankan government successfully addressing the regulatory concerns, possibly through negotiations or adjustments to the service offering that satisfy the government's security and sovereignty requirements. This resolution would need to occur swiftly enough to allow for the listing of Sri Lanka as available on the Starlink map before the July 1, 2025 deadline.

Rationale: Given the current status and the short time frame remaining, the likelihood of a significant change in the regulatory stance seems low. Regulatory processes, especially those involving security and sovereignty, can be complex and time-consuming. The fact that the issues are described as "distinct" suggests they may require more than a simple resolution. Therefore, the status quo outcome of **No** is given extra weight, as the world tends to change slowly, and significant regulatory shifts within 45 days are less common.
