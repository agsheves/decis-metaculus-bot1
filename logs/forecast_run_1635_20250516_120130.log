[2025-05-16 12:01:46] INFO: Prediction: 0.85
[2025-05-16 12:01:46] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, since as of today, Bangladesh is not listed as available on Starlink’s website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen technical difficulties or bureaucratic delays that prevent the service from being officially launched and listed on the Starlink website by July 1, 2025. For instance, if there are issues with satellite deployment, ground infrastructure, or website updates, these could delay the listing.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the successful completion of all necessary technical preparations and the timely update of the Starlink availability map to include Bangladesh. Given that regulatory approvals are complete and a technical launch date is set for May 2025, it is likely that the service will be operational and the website updated before the deadline.

Considering the information provided, the regulatory approvals, and the set technical launch date, the probability of Bangladesh being listed as available on Starlink's website before July 1, 2025, seems high. However, given the status quo and the possibility of unforeseen delays, a cautious estimate is warranted.

Probability: 85%

[2025-05-16 12:01:46] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is **No**, since as of May 16, 2025, Bangladesh is not yet listed as available on Starlink’s website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen technical issues or delays in the rollout of the service, preventing Starlink from updating their availability map to include Bangladesh by July 1, 2025. Additionally, there could be unexpected regulatory hurdles or political changes that delay the launch.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the successful completion of the technical launch in May 2025, followed by a timely update to the Starlink website to reflect Bangladesh as an available country. Given that all regulatory approvals are in place and the technical launch date is set, this scenario seems likely unless unexpected issues arise.

Rationale: Considering the information provided, all regulatory and technical milestones have been met, and there is a specific launch date set for May 2025. This suggests a high likelihood of Bangladesh being added to the Starlink availability map before the deadline. However, the status quo outcome is currently "No," and the world tends to change slowly, so there is always a possibility of unforeseen delays. Nonetheless, given the proximity of the launch date and the completion of necessary approvals, the probability of a "Yes" outcome is high.

Final Answer: "Probability: 85%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as Bangladesh is not currently listed as available on Starlink’s website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen technical difficulties or delays in the rollout of Starlink services in Bangladesh. For example, if there were issues with satellite connectivity or ground infrastructure that required additional time to resolve, this could delay the update of the availability map. Additionally, if there were any last-minute regulatory hurdles or political changes that impacted the launch timeline, this could also result in a No outcome.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the successful completion of the technical launch in May 2025, as planned, followed by a timely update to the Starlink availability map to include Bangladesh. Given that all regulatory approvals have been granted and the technical launch date is set, this scenario seems likely unless unexpected issues arise.

Rationale: Considering the information provided, the regulatory approvals are complete, and the technical launch is scheduled for May 2025. This suggests that the inclusion of Bangladesh on the Starlink availability map is imminent. However, the status quo currently reflects a No outcome, and the world tends to change slowly. Nonetheless, given the proximity of the launch date and the completion of necessary steps, the probability of a Yes outcome is relatively high.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as Bangladesh is not currently listed as available on Starlink’s website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen technical issues or delays in the rollout of Starlink services in Bangladesh. For example, there could be unexpected challenges in integrating Starlink's infrastructure with existing local telecom systems, or there might be delays in updating the Starlink website due to administrative or logistical reasons.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the successful completion of the technical launch in May 2025, as planned, followed by a timely update to the Starlink website to reflect Bangladesh's availability. Given that regulatory approvals are in place and operational demonstrations have already occurred, this scenario is quite plausible.

Rationale: The current situation suggests that all necessary regulatory and technical steps have been completed for Starlink to become available in Bangladesh. The planned technical launch in May 2025 indicates that the service is on track to be operational soon. The main uncertainty lies in the timing of the website update to reflect this availability. Given the proximity of the launch date and the importance of updating the availability map for customer acquisition, it is reasonable to expect that the website will be updated in time. However, the status quo outcome is still a **No**, and the world often changes slowly, so some weight should be given to the possibility of delays.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as Bangladesh is not currently listed as available on Starlink’s website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unforeseen technical or logistical issues that delay the rollout of Starlink services in Bangladesh. This could include delays in satellite deployment, ground station setup, or integration with local infrastructure. Additionally, bureaucratic or regulatory hurdles, such as additional approvals or compliance requirements, could also delay the official listing on the website.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the successful completion of all technical and logistical preparations for Starlink's launch in Bangladesh, followed by an update to the Starlink website reflecting Bangladesh as an available country. Given the regulatory approvals and technical launch date set for May 2025, this scenario seems likely unless unexpected issues arise.

Rationale: Given the recent developments and the fact that all regulatory and technical milestones have been met, it seems highly probable that Starlink will update its website to show Bangladesh as available before the deadline. The imminent technical launch in May 2025 further supports this likelihood. However, considering the status quo outcome and the potential for unforeseen delays, it is prudent to assign some probability to a No outcome.

Final answer: "Probability: 85%"
