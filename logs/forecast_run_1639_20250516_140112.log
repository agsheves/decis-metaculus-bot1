[2025-05-16 14:01:29] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1.5 months, as today is May 16, 2025, and the question resolves on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Yes," since the Artemis Accords have already reached 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025, with Norway being the 55th signatory.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome would involve one or more current signatories withdrawing from the Artemis Accords before July 1, 2025, reducing the total number of signatories to below 55. This scenario seems unlikely given the current trends and lack of indication of any potential withdrawals.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current status quo, where the Artemis Accords maintain or increase their number of signatories, which is already at 55 as of May 15, 2025. Additional countries joining would further solidify this outcome.

Given the current information and the historical trend of increasing signatories, the probability of the Artemis Accords having 55 or more signatories on July 1, 2025, is very high. The status quo already meets the criteria for a "Yes" outcome, and there is no indication of any withdrawals or significant geopolitical shifts that would suggest a reduction in signatories.

Probability: 95%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Yes," since the Artemis Accords already have 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025, with Norway being the latest to join.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve at least one current signatory withdrawing from the Artemis Accords before July 1, 2025. This could occur due to geopolitical tensions, changes in national policy regarding space exploration, or disagreements over the terms of the accords.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current situation where no signatories withdraw from the accords. Additionally, more countries could join, further solidifying the "Yes" outcome.

Given the current status of 55 signatories and the historical trend of increasing participation, the likelihood of a withdrawal seems low. The accords have been expanding steadily, and there is no indication of any imminent withdrawals. Therefore, the probability that the Artemis Accords will have 55 or more signatories on July 1, 2025, remains high.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the Artemis Accords will have 55 signatories on July 1, 2025. This is because Norway became the 55th signatory on May 15, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve at least one of the current signatories withdrawing from the Artemis Accords before July 1, 2025. This could occur due to geopolitical tensions, changes in national priorities, or disagreements with the terms of the accords.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current situation where the Artemis Accords have 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025, and no signatories withdraw before July 1, 2025. Additionally, more countries could join, increasing the number of signatories beyond 55.

Given the current status with 55 signatories and the historical trend of increasing signatories, the likelihood of a withdrawal seems low. The status quo is a strong indicator of the outcome, and the world tends to change slowly, supporting the probability of a Yes outcome.

Final Answer: "Probability: 95%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Yes," because the Artemis Accords already have 55 signatories as of May 15, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome would involve at least one current signatory withdrawing from the Artemis Accords before July 1, 2025. This could happen due to political changes, diplomatic disputes, or shifts in national priorities regarding space exploration.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is the continuation of the current situation, where no signatories withdraw, and the number of signatories remains at 55 or potentially increases if more countries join before July 1, 2025.

Given the current status of 55 signatories and the lack of any indication that a signatory might withdraw, the probability of the outcome being "Yes" is quite high. The status quo, which is already at the threshold required for a "Yes" resolution, is a strong indicator, and there is no current evidence suggesting a withdrawal scenario is likely.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome would involve one or more current signatories withdrawing from the Artemis Accords before July 1, 2025, reducing the number of signatories to below 55. This scenario is unlikely given the current information and the absence of any indications of potential withdrawals.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is the continuation of the current situation where the Artemis Accords maintain at least 55 signatories, or potentially gain additional signatories, by July 1, 2025. This scenario is highly likely given the recent growth in signatories and the absence of any indications of withdrawals.

Given the current status of 55 signatories and the absence of any indications of withdrawals, the status quo strongly suggests a "Yes" outcome. The world generally changes slowly, and there is no current evidence to suggest a reversal in the number of signatories. Therefore, the probability of the Artemis Accords having 55 or more signatories on July 1, 2025, is very high.
