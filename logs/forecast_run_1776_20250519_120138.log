[2025-05-19 12:01:56] INFO: Prediction: 0.75
[2025-05-19 12:01:56] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a No, as the current list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring would remain unchanged from the February 2025 update.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025 concluding without any changes to the grey list. This could happen if all jurisdictions currently on the list have not made sufficient progress to warrant removal, and no new jurisdictions have been identified as needing increased monitoring.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025 deciding to either add new jurisdictions to the grey list or remove existing ones. This could occur if certain jurisdictions have made significant improvements in their AML/CFT frameworks, leading to their removal, or if new jurisdictions have been identified as having strategic deficiencies, leading to their addition.

Rationale: Given the historical pattern of the FATF making changes to the grey list at each plenary meeting, it is likely that some changes will occur in June 2025. The FATF's process involves regular updates and reviews, and it is uncommon for a plenary meeting to pass without any adjustments to the list. Therefore, while the status quo outcome is always a possibility, the likelihood of changes being made is relatively high.

Probability: 75%

[2025-05-19 12:01:57] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025 is expected to occur within that timeframe.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a No, meaning that no jurisdictions would be added to or removed from the FATF grey list following the June 2025 plenary meeting.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if the FATF, upon reviewing the progress of the countries currently on the grey list, determines that none have made sufficient progress to warrant removal, and no new jurisdictions have exhibited deficiencies severe enough to warrant addition to the list.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if the FATF identifies a jurisdiction that has made significant improvements in its AML/CFT frameworks, leading to its removal from the grey list, or if a jurisdiction is found to have significant deficiencies, leading to its addition to the list.

Rationale: Given that the FATF updates the grey list three times a year and the most recent update was in February 2025, it is reasonable to expect potential changes in the upcoming June 2025 plenary meeting. Historically, changes to the list are not uncommon, as countries work towards addressing deficiencies or new issues arise. However, the status quo outcome suggests that no changes would occur, which is always a possibility. Nevertheless, the FATF's active monitoring and the dynamic nature of global financial regulations make it likely that some changes will occur.

Final answer: "Probability: 70%"

[2025-05-19 12:01:57] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately one month, as the FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring remains the same as it was after the February 2025 plenary meeting. This means that no jurisdictions would be added or removed from the grey list.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025 concludes without any changes to the grey list. This could occur if all jurisdictions currently on the list either continue to work on their deficiencies without sufficient progress for removal, and no new jurisdictions have been identified as needing increased monitoring.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if, during the June 2025 plenary meeting, the FATF decides to add new jurisdictions to the grey list due to identified deficiencies in their AML/CFT regimes, or if they determine that one or more jurisdictions have made sufficient progress to be removed from the list.

Rationale: Given the historical pattern of the FATF making changes to the grey list at each plenary meeting, it is reasonable to anticipate that there could be adjustments in June 2025. However, the status quo outcome should be given extra weight because changes are not guaranteed, and the world often changes slowly. The FATF's decision will depend on the progress made by jurisdictions currently on the list and any new developments in other jurisdictions.

[2025-05-19 12:01:58] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a "No," meaning no jurisdictions are added to or removed from the FATF "grey list" following the June 2025 meeting.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if the FATF, after reviewing the progress of the jurisdictions currently on the grey list, decides that none of them have made sufficient progress to warrant removal, and no new jurisdictions have demonstrated deficiencies significant enough to be added to the list.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if the FATF identifies one or more jurisdictions that have made significant improvements in their AML/CFT regimes, leading to their removal from the grey list. Alternatively, if new jurisdictions are found to have significant deficiencies in their AML/CFT frameworks, they could be added to the list.

Rationale: Given that the FATF regularly updates the grey list and the recent changes in February 2025, it is reasonable to expect that there could be further adjustments in the upcoming June 2025 meeting. The FATF's process of monitoring and updating the list is dynamic, and changes are not uncommon. However, the status quo outcome is always a strong consideration, as changes require substantial evidence of improvement or deterioration in AML/CFT regimes. Given the historical frequency of changes and the FATF's active monitoring, there is a moderate likelihood of changes occurring in the upcoming meeting.

[2025-05-19 12:01:58] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a No, as the question resolves as Yes only if there are changes to the FATF "grey list" following the June 2025 plenary meeting.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025 concludes without any additions or removals from the "Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring" list. This could occur if the countries currently on the list have not made sufficient progress to warrant removal, and no new countries have been identified as having significant deficiencies that would require their addition to the list.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if, during the June 2025 FATF Plenary meeting, one or more countries are added to or removed from the "grey list." This could happen if a country currently on the list has made significant improvements in its AML/CFT measures and is deemed compliant enough to be removed, or if a new country is identified as having significant deficiencies that warrant its addition to the list.

Rationale: Given the historical pattern of the FATF making changes to the grey list at each plenary meeting, and considering the dynamic nature of international financial regulations and compliance, there is a reasonable likelihood of changes occurring. However, the status quo outcome should be given extra weight, as changes are not guaranteed and the world often changes slowly. The FATF's decision-making process is thorough and based on the progress and deficiencies of each jurisdiction, which can sometimes lead to no changes being made.
