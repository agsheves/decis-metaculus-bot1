[2025-05-19 16:01:36] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-05-19 16:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately three weeks, as the FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 9–13, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be NO, as there have been no jurisdictions added to or removed from the FATF black list since the last plenary in February 2025, and no public indications suggest changes are imminent.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be the FATF concluding its June 2025 plenary without making any changes to the black list. This could occur if the jurisdictions currently on the list (North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran) have not made significant improvements in their AML/CFT regimes, and no new jurisdictions have deteriorated to the point of being added to the list.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the FATF identifying significant deficiencies in the AML/CFT regimes of a new jurisdiction, leading to its addition to the black list. Alternatively, one of the current jurisdictions on the list could make substantial progress in addressing its deficiencies, resulting in its removal from the list.

Rationale: Given the stability of the black list in recent plenaries and the lack of public signals indicating imminent changes, the status quo outcome is the most likely. The FATF has been more active in adjusting the grey list, suggesting that jurisdictions are more likely to transition between the grey list and compliance rather than the black list. Additionally, significant changes to the black list are typically preceded by public signals or announcements, which are currently absent.

Final Answer: "Probability: 20%"

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is NO: No jurisdictions have been added to or removed from the FATF black list since the last plenary, and there are no public indications that changes are imminent at the June 2025 meeting.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The June 2025 plenary concludes without any changes to the black list, maintaining the current list of North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran. This outcome could occur if the FATF determines that no jurisdictions have made sufficient progress to be removed or that no new jurisdictions have deteriorated to the point of being added.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: During the June 2025 plenary, the FATF decides to add a new jurisdiction to the black list due to significant deficiencies in its AML/CFT regimes, or it decides to remove a jurisdiction from the list after it has made substantial improvements and met the FATF's requirements.

Rationale: Given the stability of the black list in recent plenaries and the lack of public indications of imminent changes, the status quo outcome of NO seems more likely. The FATF has been more active in adjusting the grey list, which suggests that their focus may not be on the black list at this time. Additionally, changes to the black list are significant and often require substantial evidence and deliberation, which may not have occurred since the last plenary.

[2025-05-19 16:01:36] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-05-19 16:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
The FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 9–13, 2025. Therefore, there are approximately three weeks remaining until the outcome is known.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If no changes are made to the FATF black list during the June 2025 plenary, the outcome will be NO, meaning no jurisdictions will have been added to or removed from the black list.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
The FATF concludes its June 2025 plenary without making any changes to the black list. The focus remains on monitoring and adjusting the grey list, and no new information or developments prompt the addition or removal of jurisdictions from the black list.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
During the June 2025 plenary, the FATF identifies significant improvements or deteriorations in the AML/CFT regimes of one or more jurisdictions currently on the black list or under consideration. As a result, the FATF decides to either remove a jurisdiction from the black list due to progress or add a new jurisdiction due to emerging deficiencies.

**Rationale:**  
Given the current information and the lack of any signals or announcements regarding changes to the black list, the status quo outcome leans towards NO. The FATF has shown a recent pattern of focusing on adjustments to the grey list rather than the black list. Additionally, changes to the black list are typically significant and well-publicized, and no such indications have been reported. The world tends to change slowly, and without new developments, the probability of maintaining the status quo is higher.

**Final Answer:**  
Probability: 20%

[2025-05-19 16:01:36] INFO: Prediction: 0.8
[2025-05-19 16:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately three weeks, as the FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 9–13, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that no jurisdictions will be added to or removed from the FATF black list. The current black list consists of North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The FATF Plenary in June 2025 concludes without any changes to the black list. This could occur if the countries currently on the list have not made sufficient progress in addressing AML/CFT deficiencies, and no new countries have deteriorated to the point of being added to the list.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The FATF Plenary in June 2025 results in a jurisdiction being added to or removed from the black list. This could happen if a country currently on the list has made significant improvements in its AML/CFT regime and is deemed compliant enough to be removed. Alternatively, a new jurisdiction could be added if it has been found to have serious deficiencies in its AML/CFT measures.

Rationale: Given the information available as of May 19, 2025, there are no public indications or credible leaks suggesting imminent changes to the FATF black list at the upcoming plenary. The recent focus has been on updating the grey list, and the black list has remained stable. Historically, changes to the black list are less frequent and require significant evidence of change in a jurisdiction's AML/CFT compliance. Therefore, the status quo outcome is more likely, as the world tends to change slowly, and there is no current evidence pointing to a shift in the black list.

Probability: 80%

[2025-05-19 16:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
The FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 9–13, 2025. Today is May 19, 2025, so there are approximately three weeks left until the outcome of the question is known.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changes between now and the June 2025 plenary, the status quo outcome would be NO, meaning no jurisdictions would be added to or removed from the FATF black list.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
The June 2025 plenary concludes without any changes to the black list. The focus remains on monitoring and adjusting the grey list, as has been the trend in recent meetings. There are no new developments or compliance improvements from the current black-listed countries (North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran) that would warrant their removal, nor are there any new countries with severe AML/CFT deficiencies that would necessitate their addition to the black list.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A jurisdiction currently not on the black list experiences a significant deterioration in its AML/CFT regime, prompting the FATF to add it to the black list during the June 2025 plenary. Alternatively, one of the current black-listed countries makes substantial improvements in its AML/CFT measures and is removed from the list. Such changes would require credible evidence of either severe deficiencies or substantial improvements, respectively.

**Rationale:**  
The status quo is a strong predictor in this case, as the black list has remained unchanged in recent plenaries, and there are no current signals indicating imminent changes. The FATF has been more active in adjusting the grey list, suggesting that their focus is on jurisdictions with less severe deficiencies. Given the lack of public announcements or credible leaks about potential changes to the black list, the probability of a change occurring at the June 2025 plenary is relatively low. However, unforeseen developments could still occur, so a non-zero probability is warranted.

**Final Answer:**  
Probability: 20%
