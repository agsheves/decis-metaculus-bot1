[2025-05-19 22:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The Democratic primary for the NYC mayoral race is typically held in June. Assuming this is the case in 2025, there are likely a few weeks left until the primary date, giving AOC some time to make an endorsement if she chooses to do so.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: If AOC does not make an endorsement before the primary, the outcome would resolve as "No endorsement."

(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if a significant political event or revelation happens that prompts AOC to make a last-minute endorsement. For example, if there is a major scandal involving a frontrunner or if a candidate makes a policy proposal that aligns closely with AOC's platform, she might decide to endorse that candidate. Additionally, if there is a strong push from progressive groups or her constituents urging her to endorse a specific candidate, it might influence her decision.

Rationale:
1. The status quo outcome is "No endorsement," which is the most likely scenario given that AOC has not yet made an endorsement and there is limited time left before the primary.
2. AOC's previous endorsement of Brad Lander for Comptroller and her meeting with him suggest some possibility of endorsing him again.
3. Zohran Mamdani, being affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America like AOC, is another plausible candidate for her endorsement.
4. AOC has explicitly stated she will not endorse Andrew Cuomo, so the probability for him is very low.
5. There is always a chance she could endorse someone else or make a surprise endorsement, but these scenarios are less likely.

Final probabilities:
Zohran Mamdani: 20%
Brad Lander: 25%
Scott Stringer: 5%
Andrew Cuomo: 1%
Someone else: 9%
No endorsement: 40%

[2025-05-19 22:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The Democratic primary for the NYC mayoral race is likely to be held in June 2025, which means there is approximately one month left for AOC to make an endorsement.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: If AOC does not make a public endorsement before the primary, the outcome will resolve as "No endorsement."

(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if AOC decides to make a last-minute endorsement to try to sway the election in favor of a progressive candidate. For example, if there is a significant shift in the race dynamics or if a candidate makes a compelling case for their candidacy that aligns with AOC's values, she might decide to endorse either Zohran Mamdani or Brad Lander. Alternatively, if a new candidate emerges or if there is a major political event that changes the landscape, AOC might choose to endorse someone else.

Rationale:
1. Given that AOC has not yet made an endorsement and the primary is approaching, the status quo outcome of "No endorsement" is currently the most likely scenario. This is reinforced by the fact that political observers have noted that she may have missed her opportunity to significantly influence the race.
2. AOC's previous support for Brad Lander and her alignment with Zohran Mamdani through the Democratic Socialists of America suggest that these two candidates are the most likely to receive her endorsement if she decides to make one.
3. AOC has explicitly ruled out endorsing Andrew Cuomo, which makes it highly unlikely that she will change her stance on this.
4. While it is possible that AOC could endorse someone else or that an unexpected event could occur, these scenarios are less likely given the current information.

Final probabilities:
Zohran Mamdani: 20%
Brad Lander: 20%
Scott Stringer: 5%
Andrew Cuomo: 0%
Someone else: 5%
No endorsement: 50%

[2025-05-19 22:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The Democratic primary for the NYC mayoral race is likely to be held in June 2025, which means there is approximately one month left for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to make an endorsement.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: If AOC does not make an endorsement before the primary, the outcome will resolve as "No endorsement."

(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if AOC decides to endorse a candidate at the last minute, perhaps due to a significant change in the political landscape or a strategic decision to influence the race. For example, if Zohran Mamdani or Brad Lander were to gain significant momentum or make a compelling case for AOC's support, she might decide to endorse one of them. Alternatively, if a new candidate emerges or if there is a significant shift in public opinion, AOC might choose to endorse "Someone else."

Rationale:
1. The status quo outcome, "No endorsement," is currently the most likely scenario given that AOC has not yet made an endorsement and there is limited time left before the primary. Historically, endorsements are often made earlier in the campaign cycle to maximize influence.
2. Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander are the most likely candidates for AOC's endorsement if she decides to make one, given her past affiliations and meetings with them. Lander has the advantage of having been endorsed by AOC in the past, while Mamdani shares a political alignment with AOC through the Democratic Socialists of America.
3. Scott Stringer and Andrew Cuomo are less likely to receive AOC's endorsement. AOC has explicitly stated she will not endorse Cuomo, and there is no indication of strong support for Stringer.
4. The "Someone else" option remains a possibility, albeit a lower one, as political dynamics can change rapidly, and AOC might choose to support a different progressive candidate if circumstances warrant.

Final probabilities:
Zohran Mamdani: 20%
Brad Lander: 25%
Scott Stringer: 5%
Andrew Cuomo: 0%
Someone else: 10%
No endorsement: 40%

[2025-05-19 22:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is the period between today, May 19, 2025, and the date of the NYC mayoral Democratic primary. The primary date is not specified in the provided information, but it typically occurs in June. Assuming the primary is in mid-June, there are approximately 3-4 weeks left.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No endorsement," as AOC has not yet made an official endorsement and there is no indication that she is imminently planning to do so.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve AOC making a last-minute decision to endorse a candidate. For example, if one of the progressive candidates, such as Zohran Mamdani or Brad Lander, gains significant momentum or makes a compelling case for AOC's support, she might decide to endorse them to help solidify their position against Andrew Cuomo. Alternatively, if a new candidate emerges or an existing candidate makes a significant policy shift that aligns closely with AOC's values, she might choose to endorse them.

Rationale:
1. **Status Quo Weight**: Given that AOC has not yet endorsed anyone and the primary is approaching, the status quo outcome of "No endorsement" is a strong possibility. The world changes slowly, and endorsements, especially from high-profile figures like AOC, often come with strategic timing considerations.

2. **Progressive Candidates**: AOC's previous endorsement of Brad Lander and her affiliation with the Democratic Socialists of America, like Zohran Mamdani, suggest that these two candidates are the most likely to receive her endorsement if she decides to make one. However, the lack of a current endorsement suggests that she may be weighing her options or choosing not to endorse at all.

3. **Unexpected Outcomes**: While unlikely, it's possible that AOC could endorse someone else or make a strategic decision to influence the race at the last minute. This possibility should not be completely discounted.

Final Probabilities:
- Zohran Mamdani: 20%
- Brad Lander: 25%
- Scott Stringer: 5%
- Andrew Cuomo: 0%
- Someone else: 10%
- No endorsement: 40%

[2025-05-19 22:01:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The New York City mayoral Democratic primary is typically held in June, so there is likely about a month left until the primary occurs and the outcome is known.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed: As of now, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has not made an endorsement. If she continues to refrain from endorsing any candidate, the status quo outcome would be "No endorsement."

(c) A description of a scenario that results in an unexpected outcome: An unexpected outcome could occur if AOC decides to endorse a candidate at the last minute, perhaps due to a significant event or development in the race. For example, if there is a major scandal involving one of the leading candidates, AOC might feel compelled to endorse someone to influence the outcome. Alternatively, if one of the candidates makes a significant policy proposal that aligns closely with AOC's priorities, she might decide to endorse them to support that agenda.

Rationale:
1. **Zohran Mamdani**: Given AOC's affiliation with the Democratic Socialists of America and Mamdani's similar political alignment, there is a plausible chance she might endorse him. However, without any strong indication of her leaning towards him, the probability remains moderate.
   
2. **Brad Lander**: AOC has a history of endorsing Lander in the past, which could suggest a higher likelihood of her endorsing him again. However, without a recent endorsement, the probability is moderate.

3. **Scott Stringer**: There is no current information suggesting AOC is considering endorsing Stringer, making this a less likely option.

4. **Andrew Cuomo**: AOC has explicitly stated she will not endorse Cuomo, making this outcome highly unlikely.

5. **Someone else**: While possible, there is no current indication that AOC is considering endorsing a candidate outside of the ones mentioned, so this remains a low probability.

6. **No endorsement**: Given the current status and the fact that AOC has not yet endorsed anyone, this remains the most likely outcome unless she makes a decision soon.

Final probabilities:
- Zohran Mamdani: 20%
- Brad Lander: 25%
- Scott Stringer: 5%
- Andrew Cuomo: 0%
- Someone else: 10%
- No endorsement: 40%
