[2025-05-20 06:01:38] INFO: Prediction: 0.15
[2025-05-20 06:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 11 days, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) will remain offline, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The Department of Defense continues its climate resilience efforts without restoring the online portal. The lack of public communication or updates regarding the portal's status persists, and no technical or policy changes occur to bring the portal back online by July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: In response to internal or external pressure, the Department of Defense prioritizes the restoration of the climate resilience portal. A rapid technical update or policy decision leads to the portal being brought back online just before the resolution date, possibly as part of a broader initiative to enhance transparency and access to climate data.

Rationale: Given the current information and the status quo, the portal remains offline with no public indication of its imminent return. The Department of Defense's ongoing climate initiatives and adaptation plans do not specifically address the portal's status, suggesting that restoring the portal is not a current priority. The world tends to change slowly, and without clear signals of an impending change, the likelihood of the portal being back online by July 1, 2025, is low.

Final answer: "Probability: 15%"

[2025-05-20 06:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 11 days, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as the portal is currently offline and there is no public indication or announcement that it will be restored by the resolution date.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued lack of communication or action from the Department of Defense regarding the portal. Despite ongoing climate resilience efforts, the portal remains offline due to bureaucratic delays, lack of prioritization, or other internal factors within the DOD.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a sudden decision by the Department of Defense to restore the portal, possibly due to increased pressure from stakeholders, changes in administration priorities, or new funding allocations that prioritize the portal's functionality. This could lead to a rapid deployment of the portal back online just before or on the resolution date.

Rationale: Given the current status and lack of public indication that the portal will be restored, the status quo suggests a No outcome. The world tends to change slowly, and without any recent developments or announcements indicating a change, it is reasonable to put extra weight on the status quo. However, there is always a possibility of last-minute changes or decisions that could lead to a Yes outcome, but these are less likely given the current information.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

[2025-05-20 06:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 11 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) is currently offline and there is no public indication or announcement suggesting it will be restored by the specified date.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The Department of Defense continues its climate adaptation and resilience efforts without restoring the climate resilience portal. The focus remains on internal reports and initiatives rather than publicly accessible online resources. As a result, the portal remains offline on July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: In response to internal or external pressure, the Department of Defense decides to restore the climate resilience portal to improve transparency and support military commanders with accessible climate data. The restoration occurs before July 1, 2025, and the portal is confirmed online by the resolution source.

Rationale: Given the current status and the lack of any public announcements or indications that the portal will be restored, the status quo outcome of **No** seems more likely. The world often changes slowly, and without clear signals of change, the probability of the portal being restored by the specified date remains low. However, the possibility of last-minute decisions or actions by the Department of Defense cannot be entirely ruled out, although they seem unlikely based on the current information.

[2025-05-20 06:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the question will be resolved on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is **No**, as the US military's climate resilience portal (climate.mil) is currently offline and there is no public indication or announcement suggesting it will be restored by July 1, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The Department of Defense continues its climate adaptation and resilience efforts without prioritizing the restoration of the climate resilience portal. Despite ongoing initiatives and funding, the portal remains offline due to either bureaucratic delays, lack of prioritization, or strategic decisions to focus on other platforms or methods for disseminating climate-related information.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The Department of Defense decides to restore the climate resilience portal as part of a renewed focus on transparency and accessibility of climate data. This decision could be driven by internal advocacy, external pressure from stakeholders, or a strategic shift in policy. The restoration process is expedited, and the portal is brought back online before July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the current status quo and the lack of any public indication that the portal will be restored soon, the probability of the portal being back online by July 1, 2025, is low. The world tends to change slowly, and without any significant developments or announcements, it is reasonable to place extra weight on the status quo outcome. Additionally, the absence of any public timeline or commitment to restoring the portal suggests that it may not be a high priority for the Department of Defense at this time.

Final Answer: Probability: 20%

[2025-05-20 06:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 11 days, as the question will be resolved on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be **No**. As of the latest information, the climate resilience portal (climate.mil) is offline, and there have been no public announcements or indications that it will be restored by the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued political or administrative decisions to deprioritize or delay the restoration of the climate resilience portal. This could be due to budget constraints, shifts in policy focus, or ongoing technical or bureaucratic challenges that prevent the portal from being brought back online.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome might involve a sudden decision or announcement by the Department of Defense to prioritize the restoration of the climate resilience portal. This could be driven by increased pressure from military leaders, environmental groups, or policymakers who emphasize the importance of climate data for national security. Additionally, a change in leadership or policy direction could expedite the process of bringing the portal back online.

Rationale: Given the current status and lack of public information about the portal's restoration, the status quo outcome of **No** seems more likely. The time frame until the resolution is relatively short, and while changes can happen quickly, the absence of any indications or announcements about the portal's return suggests that the situation may remain unchanged. Good forecasting practice involves giving extra weight to the status quo, as significant changes often take time to materialize.
