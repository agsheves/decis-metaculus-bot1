[2025-05-20 16:01:29] INFO: Prediction: 0.95
[2025-05-20 16:01:29] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as today is May 20, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the US State Department's Diversity Visa page will still be online on July 1, 2025. The current operations and future plans for the Diversity Visa program suggest that the website will remain active.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve significant policy changes or legal actions that lead to the suspension or termination of the Diversity Visa program before July 1, 2025. This could be due to a shift in immigration policy by the US government, possibly influenced by political pressure or a new administration's priorities. Such changes would need to be implemented quickly to affect the website's status by the given date.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome involves the continuation of the Diversity Visa program as currently planned. The program operates on an annual cycle, and the infrastructure, including the website, is essential for applicants to check their status. The ongoing availability of the Entrant Status Check for DV-2025 and the setup for DV-2026 suggest that the website will remain operational through at least July 1, 2025.

Given the current information and the importance of the status quo, it is reasonable to assign a high probability to the website remaining online. The infrastructure is in place, and there is no immediate indication of policy changes that would disrupt the program before the specified date.

Probability: 95%

[2025-05-20 16:01:29] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as today is May 20, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that the US State Department's Diversity Visa page will still be online on July 1, 2025. This is based on the current operational status of the website and its role in the ongoing Diversity Visa program cycle.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a significant policy change or legal ruling that leads to the suspension or termination of the Diversity Visa program before July 1, 2025. This could be initiated by a new executive order, legislative action, or a court decision that mandates the discontinuation of the program and the removal of its web presence.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current operations of the Diversity Visa program, with the website remaining active to support the DV-2025 and DV-2026 cycles. This would involve no major disruptions or policy changes affecting the program's infrastructure.

Rationale: Given the information provided, the status quo strongly suggests that the Diversity Visa page will remain online through July 1, 2025. The program is currently active, with future cycles already planned and operational elements in place. While political and legal factors could potentially disrupt this status, such changes typically take time to implement and are less likely to occur within the short timeframe remaining. Therefore, the probability of the page being online is high.

Final Answer: "Probability: 90%"

[2025-05-20 16:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 11 days, as today is May 20, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that the US State Department's Diversity Visa page will still be online on July 1, 2025. This is based on the current operational status of the website and the ongoing cycle of the Diversity Visa program, which is set to continue through at least September 30, 2025, for the DV-2025 cycle, and beyond for the DV-2026 cycle.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a significant policy change or legislative action that leads to the termination of the Diversity Visa program before July 1, 2025. This could occur due to political shifts, changes in immigration policy, or a decision by the US government to discontinue the program for security or administrative reasons. Such a scenario would likely involve a formal announcement and subsequent removal of the website.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome involves the continuation of the current operations of the Diversity Visa program without any major disruptions or policy changes. The website remains online to facilitate the ongoing DV-2025 and DV-2026 cycles, as it is a critical part of the program's infrastructure for entrants to check their status.

Rationale: Given the information available, the status quo strongly suggests that the Diversity Visa page will remain online through July 1, 2025. The program's infrastructure is currently operational, and there are no indications of imminent changes that would lead to the discontinuation of the website. Additionally, the program's cycles are planned well in advance, and any significant changes would likely require time to implement. Therefore, the probability of the page remaining online is high.

Final Answer: "Probability: 95%"

[2025-05-20 16:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: Before answering the question, let's break down the components:

(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
There are approximately 1 month and 11 days remaining until July 1, 2025.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo outcome is that the US State Department's Diversity Visa page will still be online on July 1, 2025. The page is currently active and is a critical part of the Diversity Visa program's infrastructure, as it is used for entrants to check their status.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
A No outcome could occur if there is a significant policy change or legislative action that leads to the termination or suspension of the Diversity Visa program before July 1, 2025. This could be due to political decisions, changes in immigration policy, or other unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, a major technical issue or cyberattack that disables the website could also result in a No outcome.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A Yes outcome is the continuation of the current situation, where the Diversity Visa program remains operational, and the website continues to function as expected. The program's infrastructure, including the website, remains intact and accessible to entrants for checking their status.

**Rationale:**  
Given the information provided and the current status of the Diversity Visa program, the most likely outcome is that the website will remain online. The program operates on an annual cycle, and the infrastructure is already set up for the next cycle (DV-2026). The website is a critical component of the program, and there are no indications of imminent changes or disruptions. The status quo heavily favors a Yes outcome, as the world tends to change slowly, and significant policy shifts or technical issues are not anticipated within the short timeframe remaining.

**Final Answer:**  
Probability: 90%

[2025-05-20 16:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: Before providing the final probability, let's address each of the points:

(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**
   - There are approximately 1 month and 10 days left until July 1, 2025.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**
   - The status quo outcome is that the US State Department's Diversity Visa page will remain online. The program is operational, and the infrastructure is in place for the DV-2026 cycle, which suggests continuity.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**
   - A "No" outcome could occur if there is a significant policy change or legislative action that leads to the termination or suspension of the Diversity Visa program. This could be driven by political decisions, such as a new executive order or congressional action, which results in the removal of the web page. Additionally, a major cybersecurity incident or technical failure could temporarily take the page offline, although this is less likely to be permanent.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**
   - A "Yes" outcome would occur if the Diversity Visa program continues to operate as planned, with the website remaining online to support the DV-2026 cycle. Given the current setup and the importance of the website for applicants to check their status, it is likely that the page will remain operational through July 1, 2025.

**Rationale:**
The Diversity Visa program has been a longstanding component of U.S. immigration policy, and while there have been discussions and attempts to alter or eliminate it, such changes typically require significant political momentum and time. Given the current information, the infrastructure is in place for the program to continue, and there are no immediate indications of policy changes that would affect the program by July 1, 2025. Therefore, the status quo outcome, where the page remains online, is the most probable scenario.

**Final Answer:**
Probability: 90%
