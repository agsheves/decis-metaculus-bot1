[2025-05-21 04:02:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the question will be resolved on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there are currently no reports of a cube-shaped UFO sighting for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: NUFORC continues to receive and publish reports throughout June 2025, but none of these reports describe a UFO with a cube shape. This could occur if the sightings reported during that month predominantly feature other shapes, such as discs, triangles, or tic-tac shapes, which have been more commonly reported in the past.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: During June 2025, one or more individuals report a UFO sighting to NUFORC that specifically describes the object as being cube-shaped. This report is then published on the NUFORC website, meeting the criteria for the question to resolve as "Yes."

Rationale: Given the historical precedent of cube-shaped UFO sightings and the active nature of NUFORC's reporting system, it is possible that a cube-shaped UFO could be reported in June 2025. However, considering the rarity of such reports and the current status quo, the probability of a cube-shaped UFO being reported remains relatively low. Good forecasting practice involves putting extra weight on the status quo outcome, as changes in the world tend to occur slowly and gradually.

Probability: 15%

[2025-05-21 04:02:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 40 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," since as of May 21, 2025, there are no reports of cube-shaped UFO sightings for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is if NUFORC continues to receive and publish reports throughout June 2025, but none of these reports describe a UFO with a cube shape. This could happen if the types of UFOs reported are predominantly of other shapes, such as discs, spheres, or tic-tacs, which are more commonly reported.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if, during June 2025, one or more individuals report a UFO sighting to NUFORC that is specifically described as cube-shaped. This report would need to be documented and posted on the NUFORC website by the time Metaculus checks the site on or after July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the historical rarity of cube-shaped UFO reports and the current lack of such reports for June 2025, the status quo outcome leans towards "No." However, the possibility remains that a cube-shaped UFO sighting could be reported in June 2025, especially considering the active nature of NUFORC's reporting system and the hundreds of reports they receive monthly. The probability of a cube-shaped UFO being reported is not zero, but it is relatively low compared to other more common UFO shapes.

Final Answer: Probability: 15%

[2025-05-21 04:02:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," since there are currently no reports of a cube-shaped UFO sighting for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that June 2025 passes without any reports of cube-shaped UFOs being submitted to or published by NUFORC. This could occur if no sightings of cube-shaped UFOs are made, or if such sightings are made but not reported to NUFORC.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that during June 2025, one or more individuals witness a cube-shaped UFO and report it to NUFORC. NUFORC then corroborates and documents the report, and it is published on their website, meeting the criteria for a "Yes" resolution.

Rationale: Given the historical rarity of cube-shaped UFO sightings and the current status quo, the likelihood of a cube-shaped UFO being reported in June 2025 is relatively low. While NUFORC continues to receive a high volume of reports monthly, the specific shape of a cube is not commonly reported. Therefore, the status quo outcome of "No" should be given extra weight. However, the possibility remains, as evidenced by past reports, that a cube-shaped UFO could be sighted and reported.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there are currently no reports of a cube-shaped UFO sighting for June 2025, and the month has not yet begun.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is if NUFORC continues to receive and publish reports throughout June 2025, but none of these reports describe a cube-shaped UFO. Given the rarity of cube-shaped sightings historically, this scenario is plausible.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if, during June 2025, one or more individuals report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO to NUFORC, and these reports are subsequently published on their website. This could happen if there is an increase in UFO activity or if a particular sighting gains significant attention.

Rationale: The status quo outcome is "No," as there are currently no reports of cube-shaped UFOs for June 2025. Historically, cube-shaped sightings are rare, as evidenced by the limited historical data. While NUFORC continues to receive a high volume of reports monthly, the specific shape of a UFO being reported as a cube is not guaranteed. Given the rarity of such sightings and the lack of current evidence for June 2025, the probability of a cube-shaped UFO being reported remains low. However, the possibility cannot be entirely dismissed due to the unpredictable nature of UFO sightings.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be if NUFORC continues to receive and publish reports throughout June 2025, but none of these reports describe a UFO with a cube shape. This could occur if the types of UFOs reported continue to be varied, with shapes such as discs, lights, and triangles being more common.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be if, during June 2025, one or more individuals report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO to NUFORC, and this report is subsequently published on their website. This could happen if there is an increase in cube-shaped UFO sightings or if a notable incident involving a cube-shaped UFO occurs, drawing attention and leading to multiple reports.

Rationale: Given the historical data and the current status, the probability of a cube-shaped UFO being reported in June 2025 is relatively low. While there is a precedent for such sightings, they are rare. The status quo suggests that the majority of UFO reports do not involve cube shapes. However, the possibility remains due to the unpredictable nature of UFO sightings and the active reporting by NUFORC. Therefore, while the status quo outcome leans towards "No," the inherent uncertainty in UFO sightings means that a "Yes" outcome cannot be entirely ruled out.
