[2025-05-21 06:01:46] INFO: Prediction: [Percentile(value=640000.0, percentile=0.1), Percentile(value=648000.0, percentile=0.2), Percentile(value=652000.0, percentile=0.4), Percentile(value=654000.0, percentile=0.6), Percentile(value=656000.0, percentile=0.8), Percentile(value=660000.0, percentile=0.9)]
[2025-05-21 06:01:46] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be approximately 654,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would also be approximately 654,000, as there are no significant changes anticipated in the registration numbers.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest stability in the number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, given the lack of large-scale returns or deregistrations and the ongoing support from UNHCR.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a sudden and large-scale repatriation initiative or a policy change in Jordan leading to deregistration or expulsion of refugees, significantly reducing the number of registered refugees.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a new wave of refugees fleeing Syria due to unforeseen conflict or instability, leading to an increase in the number of registered refugees in Jordan.

Given the current information and the potential for unexpected scenarios, my final answer is:

[2025-05-21 06:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be approximately 654,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely remain around 654,000, as there are no significant trends indicating an increase or decrease in the refugee population.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest stability in the number of registered Syrian refugees in Jordan, with no significant changes anticipated in the near term due to the lack of large-scale returns or deregistrations.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A sudden and large-scale voluntary repatriation movement occurs due to improved conditions in Syria, leading to a significant decrease in the number of registered refugees in Jordan.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A new wave of conflict or instability in Syria prompts a fresh influx of refugees into Jordan, increasing the number of registered Syrian refugees significantly.
