[2025-05-21 10:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the resolution will occur on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No," as there is currently no specific information or indication of a pilot report of UFOs from a South American country scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the historical prevalence of UFO sightings in South America, no pilot reports a UFO sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center from any South American country during June 2025. This could be due to a lack of sightings, pilots not reporting sightings, or reports not being posted on the specified link by the resolution date.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A pilot in a South American country, such as Chile or Brazil, observes a UFO/UAP during a flight in June 2025 and reports it to the National UFO Reporting Center. The report is then posted on the specified link by the resolution date, fulfilling the criteria for a "Yes" outcome.

Rationale: Given the historical context and the established mechanisms for reporting UFOs in South America, there is a possibility of a pilot report occurring. However, the status quo outcome is "No," as there is currently no specific information indicating an upcoming report. The world tends to change slowly, and without concrete evidence or indications of an imminent report, the probability of a "Yes" outcome remains limited. Therefore, I will put extra weight on the status quo outcome.

Probability: 20%

[2025-05-21 10:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the question will be resolved on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," as there is currently no specific information or indication of a pilot report of UFOs from South American countries scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome could involve no new pilot reports of UFOs being filed in South American countries during June 2025. This could be due to a lack of sightings, pilots not reporting sightings, or reports not being submitted to or published by The National UFO Reporting Center.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome could involve a pilot in a South American country witnessing a UFO/UAP and filing a report with The National UFO Reporting Center. This report would then need to be posted on the specified link by the time Metaculus checks it on or after July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the historical context and interest in UFO sightings in South America, there is a possibility of a pilot report occurring. However, the status quo outcome is "No," and the world tends to change slowly. Without specific indications or scheduled reports, the probability of a "Yes" outcome remains relatively low.

Final Answer: "Probability: 25%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as there is currently no specific information about any pilot reports of UFOs from South American countries scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the historical interest and frequent UFO sightings in South America, no pilot reports of UFOs are submitted to the National UFO Reporting Center from any South American country during June 2025. This could be due to a lack of sightings, pilots not reporting sightings, or reports not being posted on the specified link by the resolution date.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A pilot in a South American country, such as Chile or Brazil, observes a UFO/UAP during a flight in June 2025 and submits a report to the National UFO Reporting Center. The report is then posted on the specified link by July 1, 2025, meeting the criteria for a "Yes" outcome.

Rationale: Given the historical precedent of UFO sightings in South America and the established reporting mechanisms, there is a possibility of a pilot report emerging. However, the status quo outcome is "No," and the world tends to change slowly, so the likelihood of a report being posted within the short time frame is limited. Therefore, while a "Yes" outcome is possible, it is less likely than the status quo outcome.

Final answer: "Probability: 30%"

[2025-05-21 10:01:48] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 10 days, as the resolution will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there is currently no specific information or scheduled reports of pilot UFO sightings from South American countries for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the historical interest and frequent UFO sightings in countries like Chile and Brazil, no pilot reports of UFOs are submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center from any South American country during June 2025. This could be due to a lack of new sightings, underreporting, or reports not being filed by pilots.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A pilot in Chile observes an unexplained aerial phenomenon while flying over the Andes in June 2025. The pilot promptly reports the sighting to The National UFO Reporting Center, which then posts the report on their website, fulfilling the criteria for a "Yes" resolution.

Rationale: Given the historical context and the established interest in UFOs in South America, particularly in countries like Chile and Brazil, there is a possibility of a pilot report occurring. However, the status quo outcome is "No," and changes in such patterns are typically slow. Therefore, while a "Yes" outcome is possible, the probability should reflect the current lack of specific information pointing to an imminent report.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there are currently no specific indications or scheduled reports of pilot UFO sightings from South American countries for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve no new UFO sightings being reported by pilots in South America during June 2025, or any sightings that do occur not being reported to or posted by The National UFO Reporting Center by the time the outcome is assessed.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a pilot in a South American country, such as Chile or Brazil, witnessing a UFO during a flight in June 2025 and subsequently reporting it to The National UFO Reporting Center. The report would then need to be posted on the specified link by the time Metaculus accesses it on or after July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the historical precedent of UFO sightings in South America and the existence of established reporting mechanisms, there is a possibility of a pilot report occurring. However, the status quo outcome is currently "No," and the world tends to change slowly, so it is prudent to weigh this more heavily. Without specific indications of an upcoming report, the probability of a "Yes" outcome remains moderate.
