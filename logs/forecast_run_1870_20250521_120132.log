[2025-05-21 12:01:52] INFO: Prediction: [Percentile(value=670.0, percentile=0.1), Percentile(value=680.0, percentile=0.2), Percentile(value=700.0, percentile=0.4), Percentile(value=720.0, percentile=0.6), Percentile(value=740.0, percentile=0.8), Percentile(value=760.0, percentile=0.9)]
[2025-05-21 12:01:52] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 6 weeks, as today is May 21, 2025, and the target date is July 1, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be 663 cases, as this is the most recent reported total as of April 29, 2025.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued, assuming the recent weekly increase of 9 cases persists, would be approximately 663 + (9 cases/week * 6 weeks) = 717 cases by July 1, 2025.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets are not explicitly provided, but given the recent deceleration in new cases and the significant public health response, it is likely that experts expect a continued slowing of the outbreak. However, the high contagiousness of measles and the presence of unvaccinated populations may temper overly optimistic forecasts.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A successful public health intervention, such as a highly effective vaccination campaign or quarantine measures, significantly reduces the transmission rate, leading to a rapid decline in new cases.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A super-spreader event occurs in a densely populated area with a high number of unvaccinated individuals, leading to a sudden spike in new cases and overwhelming local healthcare resources.

[2025-05-21 12:01:53] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 6 weeks remain until July 1, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If no new cases were reported from now until July 1, 2025, the total number of cases would remain at 663.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The recent trend shows a weekly increase of 9 cases. If this trend continued for the next 6 weeks, we would expect an additional 54 cases, resulting in a total of 717 cases by July 1, 2025.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts might anticipate a continued decline in the rate of new cases due to public health interventions, such as increased vaccination efforts and public awareness campaigns. However, the presence of unvaccinated populations could still pose a risk for further spread.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome could involve a highly successful public health intervention, such as a rapid increase in vaccination rates and effective containment measures, leading to a significant reduction in new cases.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: An unexpected scenario leading to a high outcome could involve a sudden outbreak in a densely populated area with low vaccination coverage, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of cases.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If no new cases were reported from today until July 1, 2025, the total number of cases would remain at 624.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The recent trend shows a weekly increase of 9 cases. If this trend continues for the next 6 weeks, we could expect an additional 54 cases, bringing the total to 678 cases by July 1, 2025.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Public health experts likely expect the number of cases to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace, due to ongoing containment efforts and vaccination campaigns. However, the high contagiousness of measles and the presence of unvaccinated populations may still drive some increase in cases.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A rapid and highly effective public health intervention, such as a sudden surge in vaccination rates or the successful isolation of affected communities, could drastically reduce the number of new cases, resulting in a lower-than-expected total.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: An unexpected event, such as a large public gathering in an affected area or a breakdown in public health infrastructure, could lead to a significant spike in cases, resulting in a higher-than-expected total.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be 663 cases, as reported by The Guardian on April 29, 2025.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued, with the recent weekly increase of 9 cases, would be approximately 717 cases by July 1, 2025. This is calculated by adding 9 cases per week for 6 weeks to the current 663 cases.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets are likely to be cautious optimism about the slowing trend, given the recent deceleration in new cases and the public health response efforts. However, the high contagiousness of measles and the presence of unvaccinated populations could still pose risks for further spread.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a significant increase in vaccination rates and effective containment measures, leading to a rapid decline in new cases, resulting in fewer than 680 cases by July 1, 2025.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could be a sudden outbreak in a densely populated area or a large public event leading to a rapid increase in cases, resulting in more than 750 cases by July 1, 2025.

[2025-05-21 12:01:54] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:  
Approximately 6 weeks remain until July 1, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:  
If no new cases were reported beyond the current count of 663, the outcome would be 663 cases.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:  
The recent trend shows an increase of 9 cases per week. If this trend continued for 6 weeks, we would expect an additional 54 cases, leading to a total of 717 cases (663 + 54).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts might expect a continued decline in the rate of new cases due to public health interventions and the natural course of outbreak dynamics. However, the presence of unvaccinated populations could sustain transmission. Markets or betting platforms, if they exist for this scenario, would likely price in the uncertainty around these factors.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:  
A successful public health intervention, such as a highly effective vaccination campaign or quarantine measures, could drastically reduce the spread, leading to a minimal increase in cases or even containment at the current level.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:  
A large public event or gathering in an affected area could lead to a super-spreader event, significantly increasing the number of cases beyond current projections.
