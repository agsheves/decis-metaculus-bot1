[2025-05-22 10:01:38] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-05-22 10:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately 1 month and 9 days, as the resolution will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No," as there are currently no documented pilot reports of UFOs from African countries specifically scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve no new UFO sightings being reported by pilots in African countries during June 2025. This could be due to a lack of unusual aerial phenomena during that period, or pilots not reporting any sightings to the National UFO Reporting Center.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a pilot in an African country witnessing and reporting a UFO sighting to the National UFO Reporting Center during June 2025. This report would then need to be documented and posted on the specified link by the resolution date.

Rationale: Given the historical context of UFO sightings in Africa and the mention of pilot reports in South Africa, there is a possibility of a report occurring. However, the lack of specific information or patterns indicating increased UFO activity in June 2025, combined with the general tendency for the status quo to prevail, suggests that the probability of a report is relatively low. The world tends to change slowly, and without any current indications of increased UFO activity or specific events that might lead to a report, the likelihood remains modest.

Final Answer: "Probability: 20%"

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No," since there are currently no documented pilot reports of UFOs from African countries specifically scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the continuation of the current trend where no pilot reports of UFOs are submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center from African countries during June 2025. This could be due to a lack of sightings, underreporting, or reports not being filed in time for the resolution date.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a pilot in an African country witnessing a UFO and submitting a report to The National UFO Reporting Center during June 2025. This could be triggered by an unusual astronomical event, increased military or aviation activity, or simply a random occurrence that leads to a sighting.

Rationale: Given the historical context of UFO sightings in Africa and the specific mention of pilot reports in South Africa, there is a non-zero probability of a report occurring. However, the lack of recent reports and the absence of any specific indicators pointing to increased UFO activity in June 2025 suggest that the status quo outcome of "No" is more likely. Good forecasting practice involves putting extra weight on the status quo outcome, as changes in the world tend to happen slowly and unpredictably.

[2025-05-22 10:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately 1 month and 9 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No," since there is currently no documented pilot report of a UFO from an African country for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is if no pilot reports a UFO sighting in any African country during June 2025, or if such a report is not posted by The National UFO Reporting Center by the time Metaculus checks the link on or after July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if a pilot in an African country reports a UFO sighting during June 2025, and this report is subsequently posted on The National UFO Reporting Center's website by the time Metaculus checks the link on or after July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the historical context of UFO sightings in Africa and the mention of pilot reports in South Africa, there is a non-zero probability of a pilot report occurring. However, the lack of specific information or patterns indicating increased UFO activity in June 2025, combined with the status quo being "No," suggests that the probability of a "Yes" outcome remains relatively low. Historical patterns and the slow-changing nature of such events mean that the status quo outcome should be given more weight.

[2025-05-22 10:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 39 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as there are currently no documented pilot reports of UFOs from African countries specifically scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the continuation of the current trend where no new pilot reports of UFOs from African countries are submitted to The National UFO Reporting Center for June 2025. This could be due to a lack of sightings, underreporting, or other factors that prevent such reports from being filed or published.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a pilot in an African country observing a UFO/UAP during a flight in June 2025 and subsequently reporting the sighting to The National UFO Reporting Center. This report would then need to be published on the specified link by the center by July 1, 2025. Factors that could contribute to this scenario include increased awareness or interest in UFO phenomena, a rise in aerial activity, or unusual atmospheric conditions that lead to sightings.

Rationale: Given the historical context of UFO sightings in Africa and the specific mention of pilot reports in South Africa, there is a non-zero probability of a pilot report occurring in June 2025. However, the lack of recent reports and the absence of any specific indicators suggesting an increased likelihood of such an event in June 2025 suggest that the status quo outcome of "No" is more probable. The world tends to change slowly, and without specific evidence pointing to an imminent report, the likelihood of a "Yes" outcome remains limited.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No" because there is currently no documented pilot report of a UFO from an African country scheduled or anticipated for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve no new UFO sightings being reported by pilots in Africa during June 2025, or any sightings that do occur not being reported to The National UFO Reporting Center. Additionally, if any reports are made, they might not be posted on the specified link by the resolution date.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a pilot in an African country witnessing a UFO/UAP in June 2025 and subsequently reporting it to The National UFO Reporting Center. The report would then need to be posted on the specified link by the resolution date for the question to resolve as "Yes."

Rationale: Given the historical context of UFO sightings in Africa, there is a possibility for a pilot report to emerge. However, the lack of recent pilot reports and the absence of any specific indicators pointing to increased UFO activity in June 2025 suggest that the status quo outcome is more likely. The world tends to change slowly, and without any new developments or patterns indicating an increase in UFO sightings, the probability of a "Yes" outcome remains relatively low.
