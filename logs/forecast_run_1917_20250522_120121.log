[2025-05-22 12:01:40] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately six weeks, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 22, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a **No**. Rippling's CEO has explicitly stated that an IPO is not in their near-term plans, and there are no indications of IPO preparation activities.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is Rippling continuing its current strategy of remaining private, utilizing its recent funding to support growth and liquidity for employees through tender offers, without any announcements or filings related to an IPO before the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is a sudden strategic shift by Rippling, possibly driven by market conditions or investor pressure, leading to an unexpected announcement of IPO plans. This could involve filing an SEC Form S-1 or making an announcement on their website before July 1, 2025.

Given the current information, the explicit statement from the CEO, and the lack of preparatory actions for an IPO, the probability of Rippling announcing IPO plans before the deadline is low. The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome, and significant changes in such a short timeframe are unlikely.

Probability: 10%

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be **No**, as Rippling's CEO has explicitly stated that an IPO is "not in the near-time plans," and there have been no indications of IPO preparation activities.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Rippling continuing its current trajectory without making any public announcements or filings regarding an IPO. The company remains privately held, leveraging its recent funding rounds and tender offers to provide liquidity for employees and investors without going public.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a sudden strategic shift by Rippling, possibly due to unforeseen market conditions or investor pressure, leading to an unexpected announcement of an IPO plan. This could include filing an SEC Form S-1 or making an announcement on their website, despite the CEO's previous statements.

Given the current information and the short time frame remaining, the likelihood of a Yes outcome is low. The company's recent funding success and explicit statements against near-term IPO plans suggest stability in their private status.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question resolves as **No**, given the current statements from Rippling's CEO and the company's recent financial activities.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that Rippling continues to operate without announcing an IPO. The company uses its recent funding to fuel growth and provide liquidity through tender offers, maintaining its private status and not filing any S-1 documentation or making any announcements on its website regarding an IPO.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that Rippling unexpectedly decides to pursue an IPO due to a strategic shift or external pressures, such as changes in market conditions or investor demands. This would involve Rippling filing an SEC Form S-1 or making an announcement on its website about its intention to go public before the July 1, 2025 deadline.

Given the information available, the status quo heavily leans towards a No outcome, as the CEO has explicitly stated that an IPO is not in the near-term plans, and the company has recently secured substantial funding. The likelihood of a sudden shift towards an IPO announcement in the remaining six weeks is relatively low.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be a **No**. This is based on the CEO's explicit statement that an IPO is "not in the near-time plans" and the company's recent substantial funding round, which suggests they have the capital needed without going public.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Rippling continues to operate as a private company, leveraging its recent funding round to fuel growth and provide liquidity to employees through the planned tender offer. The company does not make any moves towards an IPO, such as filing an SEC Form S-1 or making an announcement on their website.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Despite the CEO's recent statements, Rippling experiences a significant change in strategic direction due to unforeseen circumstances, such as a major acquisition opportunity that requires additional capital or pressure from investors to go public. This leads to an unexpected announcement of an IPO plan, including the filing of an SEC Form S-1 or an official announcement on their website.

Given the current information and the short time frame remaining, the probability of Rippling announcing an IPO plan before July 1, 2025, appears low. The company's recent funding and the CEO's statements suggest a strong inclination to remain private for the near term.

[2025-05-22 12:01:42] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately six weeks, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 22, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as Rippling's CEO has explicitly stated that an IPO is not in their near-term plans, and there have been no recent activities indicating preparation for an IPO.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Rippling continues to operate as a private company, leveraging its recent funding rounds to maintain financial stability and growth. The company does not file an SEC Form S-1 or make any announcements regarding an IPO on its website before July 1, 2025. The tender offer to repurchase equity from employees and investors provides sufficient liquidity, reducing the immediate need for a public offering.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Despite the CEO's recent statements, Rippling experiences a strategic shift or external pressure from investors to pursue an IPO. This could be due to market conditions, competitive pressures, or a desire to capitalize on a favorable valuation environment. Consequently, Rippling files an SEC Form S-1 or makes an official announcement on its website before July 1, 2025, indicating plans for an IPO.

Rationale: Given the explicit statement from Rippling's CEO and the recent substantial funding round, the status quo strongly suggests a No outcome. The company appears to have sufficient financial resources without needing to go public, and there are no current signs of IPO preparation activities. While unexpected changes can occur, the likelihood of such a shift happening within the next six weeks is low. Therefore, the probability of Rippling announcing an IPO plan before July 1, 2025, is minimal.

Final answer: "Probability: 5%"
