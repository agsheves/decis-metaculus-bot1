[2025-05-22 18:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 year and 1 month, or until July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the government of Mali will not reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties, resulting in a "No" outcome.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the military junta maintaining its grip on power, continuing to suppress dissent, and ignoring both domestic and international pressure to reinstate political parties. The junta may prioritize its control and security over democratic reforms, leading to no reversal of the decree.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve significant internal or external pressure that forces the junta to reconsider its stance. This could include increased international sanctions, diplomatic isolation, or a strong domestic uprising that threatens the stability of the regime. Additionally, a shift in the junta's leadership or a strategic decision to legitimize their rule through some form of political pluralism could lead to a reversal.

Rationale: Given the current situation, the military junta in Mali appears to be consolidating power and has shown no signs of reversing its decision. The international community's condemnation and domestic protests have not yet resulted in any change. Historically, military regimes often resist external pressure unless it poses a direct threat to their stability. Therefore, the status quo outcome is more likely, as the world tends to change slowly, and entrenched regimes are typically resistant to rapid policy reversals.

Final Answer: "Probability: 30%"

[2025-05-22 18:01:47] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-05-22 18:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a **No**. The government of Mali has not reversed its decision to dissolve all political parties, and the decree remains in effect.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The military government continues to consolidate its power, ignoring both domestic protests and international condemnation. The junta maintains its repressive policies, suppressing dissent and preventing any legal or political challenges from gaining traction. The political environment remains highly controlled, with no indication of a reversal of the decree before the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Significant internal pressure from civil society groups and political parties, combined with increased international diplomatic efforts and potential sanctions, forces the junta to reconsider its position. A legal challenge to the decree gains momentum, possibly leading to a court ruling against the dissolution. The government, seeking to ease tensions and improve its international standing, announces a reversal of the decree, allowing political parties to operate once again.

Rationale: Given the current repressive environment and the junta's history of consolidating power, the status quo outcome is more likely. The military government has shown little willingness to reverse its decisions, and the time frame until the deadline is short. While international pressure and domestic protests could potentially influence the government, the likelihood of a significant policy reversal in such a short period is low. Therefore, I place extra weight on the status quo outcome.

Final Answer: Probability: 20%

[2025-05-22 18:01:48] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a **No**—the government of Mali has not reversed its decision to dissolve all political parties.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The military government in Mali continues to consolidate its power, ignoring both domestic protests and international condemnation. The junta maintains its repressive measures, including arrests and media restrictions, to suppress any opposition. The political environment remains highly controlled, with no legal or political challenges successfully reversing the decree. As a result, the decree dissolving all political parties remains in effect past July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Significant internal pressure from civil society groups and political parties, combined with intensified international diplomatic efforts and potential economic sanctions, forces the military government to reconsider its stance. In response to mounting pressure, the government announces a reversal of the decree, reinstating the legal framework for political parties and allowing new parties to form, thus complying with the 2023 constitution and international human rights obligations.

Rationale: Given the current repressive political environment, the junta's consolidation of power, and the lack of any indication of a policy reversal, the status quo outcome is heavily weighted towards a No. The military government has shown resilience against both domestic and international pressure, and with only a short time remaining until the deadline, a significant change seems unlikely. However, the possibility of a Yes outcome cannot be entirely dismissed, especially if international pressure escalates or if there is a shift in internal dynamics.

Final answer: "Probability: 85%"

[2025-05-22 18:01:48] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a **No**. The government of Mali has not reversed its decision to dissolve all political parties, and there are no indications of an imminent reversal.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The military government continues its current trajectory, maintaining a tight grip on power and suppressing dissent. Despite international condemnation and domestic protests, the junta remains steadfast in its decision, prioritizing its control over any potential political liberalization. The decree dissolving political parties remains in place beyond July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Significant internal or external pressure leads to a change in the junta's stance. This could involve increased international sanctions or diplomatic efforts, combined with sustained domestic protests that threaten the stability of the regime. In response, the government announces a reversal of the decree, allowing political parties to reform and new parties to be established, as a means to ease tensions and restore some level of political pluralism.

Rationale: Given the current situation, the status quo heavily favors a No outcome. The military government has shown a strong inclination to consolidate power, and there are no credible signs of a shift in policy. While international pressure and domestic protests exist, they have not yet resulted in any meaningful change. Historically, military regimes are often resistant to reversing decisions that could weaken their control, especially in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a reversal before the deadline is relatively low.

Final answer: "Probability: 15%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a **No**—the government of Mali has not reversed its decision to dissolve all political parties.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The military junta continues to consolidate its power, ignoring both domestic protests and international pressure. The repressive environment persists, with continued arrests and suppression of opposition figures. The junta maintains its stance on the dissolution of political parties, and no legal or political challenges succeed in reversing the decree. As a result, the decree remains in effect past July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Significant domestic unrest and international pressure lead to a shift in the junta's stance. Perhaps due to economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, or a successful legal challenge based on the 2023 constitution, the government decides to reverse its decision. The reversal is announced, allowing for the reinstatement of political parties and the formation of new ones, thus restoring some level of political pluralism in Mali.

Rationale: Given the current situation, the status quo heavily favors a No outcome. The junta has shown a strong inclination to maintain control and suppress opposition, and there is no indication of an imminent reversal. The international community's condemnation has not yet resulted in a change of policy, and domestic protests have been met with repression. While political situations can change rapidly, especially under pressure, the likelihood of a reversal seems low at this point. Therefore, the probability of a No outcome is higher.
