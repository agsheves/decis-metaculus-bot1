[2025-05-22 22:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 9 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a **No**. As of now, there is no evidence that either Donald Trump or Elon Musk has tweeted specifically about the Diversity Visa program using the exact words "diversity visa."

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that neither Trump nor Musk tweets about the Diversity Visa program using the exact phrase "diversity visa" before July 1, 2025. They may continue to focus on other visa programs, such as the H-1B visa, or other immigration-related issues without mentioning the Diversity Visa specifically.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that either Trump or Musk decides to comment on the Diversity Visa program in a tweet, perhaps in response to a significant policy change, public debate, or media coverage related to the program. This could be prompted by a new court ruling, legislative action, or a high-profile news story that brings the Diversity Visa program into the spotlight.

Given that the status quo outcome is currently a No and that there is limited time remaining for a change to occur, the probability of a Yes outcome is relatively low. However, it is not impossible, as both Trump and Musk are known for their unpredictable social media activity.

Probability: 10%

[2025-05-22 22:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is **No**, as there is currently no evidence that either Donald Trump or Elon Musk has tweeted about the Diversity Visa program using the exact words "diversity visa" before April 1, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is the continuation of the current situation where neither Trump nor Musk tweets about the Diversity Visa program using the specified phrase by the time the outcome is determined. This could be due to their focus on other visa programs, such as the H-1B visa, or other priorities that do not involve the Diversity Visa.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve either Trump or Musk deciding to tweet about the Diversity Visa program using the exact words "diversity visa" before the outcome is determined. This could happen if there is a sudden policy change, public controversy, or personal interest that prompts them to address the Diversity Visa specifically.

Given the information and the status quo, the likelihood of a Yes outcome seems low. The world tends to change slowly, and without any current indication of interest in the Diversity Visa program from Trump or Musk, the probability of a Yes outcome is limited.

Probability: 5%

[2025-05-22 22:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is from today, May 22, 2025, until July 1, 2025. This gives approximately 40 days for any potential tweets to be made by Donald Trump or Elon Musk regarding the Diversity Visa.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a **No**. As of now, there is no evidence that either Trump or Musk has tweeted about the Diversity Visa program using the exact words required by the question.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is the continuation of the current situation where neither Trump nor Musk tweets about the Diversity Visa program. Given the lack of current evidence and the focus on other visa programs like the H-1B and the "gold card" visa, it's plausible that they may not address the Diversity Visa specifically in the remaining time.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve either Trump or Musk deciding to comment on the Diversity Visa program explicitly. This could be triggered by a new policy announcement, a significant news event related to the Diversity Visa, or a public debate that brings the program into the spotlight, prompting one of them to tweet about it.

Given the information and the status quo, the likelihood of a Yes outcome is relatively low. The focus has been on other visa programs, and there is no current indication that the Diversity Visa program is a priority topic for either Trump or Musk.

[2025-05-22 22:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the question will resolve as **No**. This is because, as of the current date (May 22, 2025), there is no evidence that either Donald Trump or Elon Musk has tweeted about the Diversity Visa program using the exact words "diversity visa."

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is the continuation of the current situation, where neither Trump nor Musk tweets about the Diversity Visa program using the specified phrase before the deadline. Given that the deadline for the tweets to be made was April 1, 2025, and the current date is already past that, this scenario is highly likely unless new information emerges.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the discovery of a previously overlooked tweet or X post by either Trump or Musk that contains the exact phrase "diversity visa" and was made before April 1, 2025. Alternatively, an error in the search results could be corrected, revealing such a tweet.

Given the information available and the fact that the deadline for the tweets has already passed, the likelihood of a Yes outcome is very low. The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome, as no evidence of the required tweets has been found.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Either Donald Trump or Elon Musk decides to address the Diversity Visa program directly in a tweet, possibly in response to a significant news event, policy change, or public debate related to the program. This could be triggered by a court ruling, legislative action, or a high-profile incident involving the Diversity Visa program that captures public attention.

Given that the current status quo outcome is **No** and considering the limited time remaining for the question to resolve, the probability of a Yes outcome is relatively low. The world tends to change slowly, and without a clear catalyst for either Trump or Musk to tweet specifically about the Diversity Visa, the likelihood of a Yes outcome remains minimal.
