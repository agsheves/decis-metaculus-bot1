[2025-05-23 02:14:00] INFO: Prediction: 0.95
[2025-05-23 02:14:00] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 year and 1 month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 23, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question resolves as **Yes**, since Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa before the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Rob Sand retracting his candidacy announcement before July 1, 2025, and explicitly stating that he is no longer running for governor. This would need to be a clear and public withdrawal of his candidacy.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current situation where Rob Sand has declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa, and no retraction or withdrawal occurs before July 1, 2025. This is the status quo and the most likely scenario given the current information.

Given that Rob Sand has already announced his candidacy and there is no indication of a potential retraction, the status quo strongly supports a Yes outcome. The world tends to change slowly, and political candidacy announcements are typically not retracted unless there are significant unforeseen circumstances.

Probability: 95%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question resolves as **Yes**, since Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa before the specified date.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Rob Sand retracting his candidacy declaration before July 1, 2025, and not re-declaring by that date. This could happen if unforeseen personal, political, or legal issues arise that compel him to withdraw from the race.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current situation where Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy for governor, and no retraction occurs before the deadline. This is the most likely scenario given the current information.

Given the current status and the fact that Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy, the probability of the question resolving as Yes is very high. The status quo strongly supports a Yes outcome, and the world tends to change slowly, making a retraction unlikely without significant new developments.

[2025-05-23 02:14:00] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 7 days, as today is May 23, 2025, and the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question resolves as **Yes**, since Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa before the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Rob Sand retracting his candidacy announcement before July 1, 2025, and making a public statement that he is no longer running for governor. This would need to be a clear and official withdrawal of his candidacy.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current situation, where Rob Sand has declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa, and no retraction or withdrawal occurs before July 1, 2025.

Given the current information and the fact that Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy, the status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The likelihood of him retracting his candidacy announcement within the next month is relatively low, especially considering the political and logistical challenges associated with such a move. Therefore, the probability of the question resolving as Yes is high.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question resolves as **Yes**, because Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa before the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Rob Sand retracting his candidacy announcement or some unforeseen event leading to the invalidation of his candidacy before July 1, 2025. This could include legal challenges, personal decisions to withdraw, or other political developments that cause him to step down from the race.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current situation where Rob Sand remains a declared candidate for governor of Iowa, with no retraction or invalidation of his candidacy occurring before the deadline.

Given the current information and the fact that Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy, the probability of the question resolving as Yes is very high. The status quo strongly supports a Yes outcome, and significant changes would be required for a No outcome to occur.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Rob Sand retracting his candidacy announcement before July 1, 2025, and not declaring again before that date. This could happen if unforeseen circumstances, such as personal issues, political strategy changes, or significant shifts in the political landscape, prompt him to withdraw.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current situation where Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy for governor of Iowa, and there are no indications or announcements of him retracting this decision before July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given that Rob Sand has already declared his candidacy and there is no current information suggesting he will retract this decision, the status quo strongly leans towards a Yes outcome. The world tends to change slowly, and once a political figure has publicly committed to a campaign, it is relatively rare for them to withdraw unless faced with significant personal or political challenges. Therefore, the probability of the question resolving as Yes is very high.
