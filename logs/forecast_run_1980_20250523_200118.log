[2025-05-23 20:01:38] INFO: Prediction: 0.9
[2025-05-23 20:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as today is May 23, 2025, and the question resolves on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "Yes," as a 12-pack of Coca-Cola is currently listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on Amazon, and non-alcoholic beverages are explicitly eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits according to current guidelines.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome would involve a policy change by the USDA or Amazon that removes non-alcoholic beverages, such as Coca-Cola, from the list of SNAP-eligible items. This could be due to lobbying efforts, public health initiatives, or legislative changes that aim to restrict the types of products that can be purchased with SNAP benefits.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is the continuation of the current policies, where non-alcoholic beverages remain eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits, and Amazon continues to list these items as "SNAP EBT eligible." No significant policy changes occur before July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the short time frame until the resolution date and the absence of any current indications of policy changes, the status quo is likely to persist. Historically, changes to SNAP eligibility guidelines have been gradual and subject to significant debate and legislative processes. Therefore, the probability of a sudden change affecting the eligibility of Coca-Cola within the next month is low.

Probability: 90%

[2025-05-23 20:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as today is May 23, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "Yes," as a 12-pack of Coca-Cola is currently listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on Amazon, and there are no indications of imminent policy changes affecting this status.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a policy change by the USDA or Amazon that removes non-alcoholic beverages, such as Coca-Cola, from the list of SNAP-eligible items. This could be driven by political pressure or health advocacy groups lobbying for the exclusion of sugary drinks from SNAP benefits.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the continuation of current policies, with no changes to the SNAP eligibility guidelines for non-alcoholic beverages. This would mean that Coca-Cola remains eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits on Amazon, and the listing retains the "SNAP EBT eligible" tag.

Rationale:
Given the short time frame remaining until the outcome is determined, and the lack of any current indications of policy changes, the status quo is likely to persist. Historically, changes to SNAP eligibility guidelines have been slow and subject to significant debate and legislative processes. Additionally, both Amazon and the USDA have maintained consistent policies regarding SNAP eligibility for non-alcoholic beverages. Therefore, the probability of a "Yes" outcome is high, as the world tends to change slowly, and there is no immediate evidence suggesting a shift in policy.

Final Answer: Probability: 85%

[2025-05-23 20:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as today is May 23, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "Yes," as a 12-pack of Coca-Cola is currently listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on Amazon.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a policy change by the USDA that removes non-alcoholic beverages, including soft drinks, from the list of SNAP-eligible items. This could be due to increased lobbying pressure or a shift in public health policy aimed at reducing the consumption of sugary drinks among SNAP recipients. Alternatively, Amazon could independently decide to change its labeling or eligibility criteria for SNAP purchases, although this is less likely without a corresponding change in USDA policy.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the continuation of current policies, with no significant changes to the USDA's SNAP eligibility guidelines or Amazon's implementation of the program. Given the current status and lack of indications of impending changes, this scenario is more likely.

Rationale: Given the historical stability of SNAP eligibility guidelines and the current status quo, it is reasonable to assume that there will be no significant changes in the short time frame remaining until the outcome is determined. The lobbying efforts by companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to maintain the inclusion of sugary drinks in the SNAP program further support the likelihood of a Yes outcome. Additionally, the absence of any announcements or indications of policy changes from the USDA or Amazon suggests that the status quo will persist.

Final Answer: Probability: 85%

[2025-05-23 20:01:42] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month and 8 days, as today is May 23, 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Yes," as a 12-pack of Coca-Cola is currently listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on Amazon, and there are no indications of pending policy changes that would alter this status.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a change in USDA SNAP eligibility guidelines that specifically excludes non-alcoholic beverages like Coca-Cola from being purchased with SNAP benefits. This could be due to lobbying efforts or policy shifts aimed at promoting healthier food choices within the SNAP program. If such a change were implemented before July 1, 2025, and Amazon updated its listings accordingly, the outcome would be "No."

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome involves the continuation of current policies, where non-alcoholic beverages remain eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. Given that there are no current indications of policy changes, and Amazon continues to list Coca-Cola as "SNAP EBT eligible," this scenario is more likely. Additionally, any lobbying efforts by companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to maintain the status quo could further support this outcome.

Rationale: Given the short time frame until the outcome is determined and the lack of any current indications of policy changes, the status quo is likely to persist. The USDA's SNAP eligibility guidelines have historically included non-alcoholic beverages, and Amazon's current listings reflect this. While policy changes are always possible, they typically require time to implement and communicate, making a sudden shift unlikely within the next month.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Yes," as a 12-pack of Coca-Cola is currently listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on Amazon, and non-alcoholic beverages are explicitly included in the SNAP eligibility guidelines.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: A change in USDA policy or Amazon's implementation of SNAP EBT eligibility occurs before July 1, 2025, specifically excluding non-alcoholic beverages like Coca-Cola from being eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. This could be driven by political pressure or lobbying efforts that lead to a re-evaluation of what constitutes an eligible item under SNAP.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: No changes occur to the USDA's SNAP eligibility guidelines or Amazon's implementation of these guidelines before July 1, 2025. Non-alcoholic beverages, including Coca-Cola, remain eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits, and the product continues to be listed as "SNAP EBT eligible" on Amazon.

Rationale: Given the short time frame until the resolution date and the lack of any current indications of policy changes, the probability of the status quo being maintained is high. The USDA's SNAP guidelines have historically included non-alcoholic beverages, and there is no immediate evidence suggesting that Amazon or the USDA plans to alter this policy. Changes to such programs typically involve lengthy legislative or administrative processes, which are unlikely to be completed in the remaining time frame.
