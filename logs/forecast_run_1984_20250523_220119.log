[2025-05-23 22:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 38 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," since as of now, Discord has not made an official announcement about planning an IPO.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Discord continuing its preparations and discussions with investment bankers but deciding to delay the IPO announcement due to market conditions, internal strategic decisions, or other unforeseen circumstances. This could result in no official announcement being made before the July 1, 2025 deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve Discord finalizing its preparations and deciding that market conditions are favorable for an IPO. Consequently, they could file an SEC Form S-1 or make a specific announcement on their website's news section about their plans to go public before the deadline.

Given the current status and the fact that no official announcement has been made yet, the likelihood of a Yes outcome is uncertain but possible. However, considering the weight of the status quo and the fact that the world changes slowly most of the time, the probability of a No outcome remains higher.

Probability: 60%

[2025-05-23 22:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 38 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," since, as of now, Discord has not made an official announcement about planning an IPO.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Discord continues its discussions with investment bankers but decides to delay any official announcement of an IPO until after July 1, 2025, perhaps due to market conditions or strategic considerations. Alternatively, they might opt for a different financial strategy, such as another round of private funding.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Discord finalizes its IPO plans and files an SEC Form S-1 or makes a specific announcement on its website's news section before July 1, 2025, detailing their intention to go public.

Given the current status quo and the historical tendency for companies to take time in preparing for an IPO, the likelihood of a last-minute announcement is relatively low. However, the fact that Discord is actively engaging with investment bankers suggests that a Yes outcome is still possible. Balancing these factors, the probability of Discord announcing an IPO plan before the deadline is:

Probability: 30%

[2025-05-23 22:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 38 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," since, as of May 23, 2025, Discord has not made an official announcement about planning an IPO.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Discord continues its discussions with investment bankers but decides to delay any official announcement of an IPO due to market conditions, internal strategic decisions, or regulatory considerations. As a result, no SEC Form S-1 is filed, and no specific announcement is made on Discord's website before July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Discord finalizes its preparations and decides to move forward with the IPO process. The company files an SEC Form S-1 or makes a specific announcement on its website about its intention to go public before July 1, 2025, possibly driven by favorable market conditions or strategic timing considerations.

Rationale: Given the information available, Discord is actively preparing for an IPO, as indicated by its meetings with investment bankers and its growth trajectory. However, no official announcement has been made yet. The status quo outcome is "No," and forecasters should consider that the world changes slowly most of the time. While there is potential for a Yes outcome, the probability should reflect the current lack of an official announcement and the typical pace of such developments.

Final Answer: "Probability: 40%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," since, as of now, Discord has not made an official announcement about planning an IPO through an SEC Form S-1 filing or a specific announcement on their website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Discord deciding to delay its IPO plans due to unfavorable market conditions or internal strategic shifts. For example, if the financial markets become volatile or if Discord's leadership decides to focus on further growth and development before going public, they might postpone the IPO announcement beyond the July 1, 2025, deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve Discord finalizing its IPO preparations and deciding to make an official announcement within the next 38 days. This could happen if market conditions are favorable, and Discord's leadership feels confident in the company's readiness to go public. An announcement could be made through an SEC Form S-1 filing or a specific post on their website's news section.

Rationale: Given the current information, Discord is actively preparing for an IPO and has engaged with investment banks, which indicates a strong possibility of an announcement. However, the status quo outcome is "No," as no official announcement has been made yet. Considering the short time frame and the tendency for the world to change slowly, the probability of a "Yes" outcome is moderate but not guaranteed.

Final answer: "Probability: 60%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there has been no official announcement from Discord regarding an IPO plan, either through an SEC Form S-1 filing or a specific announcement on their website.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Discord continues its discussions with investment bankers but decides to delay any official IPO announcement due to market conditions, internal strategic decisions, or other unforeseen circumstances. As a result, no SEC Form S-1 is filed, and no specific announcement is made on their website before July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Discord finalizes its preparations and decides to move forward with an IPO. They file an SEC Form S-1 or make a specific announcement on their website regarding their plans to go public before the deadline of July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the current status, Discord is actively preparing for a potential IPO, but no official announcement has been made yet. The status quo outcome is "No," as there is no definitive public information indicating an imminent announcement. While the company is a strong candidate for an IPO and has been meeting with investment bankers, the lack of a formal announcement at this point suggests that the probability of an announcement before July 1, 2025, is not overwhelmingly high. Considering the tendency for the world to change slowly and the weight of the status quo, the probability of Discord announcing an IPO plan before the deadline is moderate but not certain.

Final Answer: "Probability: 60%"
