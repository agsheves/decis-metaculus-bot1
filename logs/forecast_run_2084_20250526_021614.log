[2025-05-26 02:16:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately five days, as today is May 26, 2025, and the outcome will be known by the end of June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "zero," as there have been no new Level 4 advisories announced for June 2025 as of May 26, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflict or a significant terrorist threat in a country that is currently not under a Level 4 advisory. For example, if a country with existing tensions or instability, such as a nation in the Middle East or Africa, experiences a sudden coup or a major terrorist attack, the U.S. State Department might issue a new Level 4 advisory. Additionally, a severe natural disaster or health crisis could also prompt a new advisory if it significantly impacts the safety of U.S. citizens.

Given the current information and the tendency for the world to change slowly, the status quo outcome of "zero" is the most likely. However, the possibility of unexpected events means that some probability should be assigned to the other options.

Final probabilities:
Zero: 70%
One: 20%
Two: 7%
Greater than two: 3%

[2025-05-26 02:16:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately five days, as today is May 26, 2025, and the question resolves based on the number of new Level 4 travel advisories issued in June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "zero," as there have been no new Level 4 advisories announced for June 2025 as of the current date, May 26, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflict or a significant terrorist attack in a country that is currently not under a Level 4 advisory. For example, if there were a sudden outbreak of violence or a major terrorist incident in a country with existing tensions, the State Department might issue a new Level 4 advisory. Additionally, a severe natural disaster or a rapid deterioration in political stability in a country could also lead to an unexpected advisory.

Given the information and the typical slow pace of change in global travel advisories, the most likely outcome remains "zero." However, the possibility of unforeseen events means that there is still some probability for other outcomes.

Final probabilities:
- Zero: 70%
- One: 20%

[2025-05-26 02:16:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately five days, as today is May 26, 2025, and the outcome will be determined by the end of June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "zero" new Level 4 travel advisories issued in June 2025. As of the latest information, there have been no announcements or indications of new advisories being planned for June.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation in geopolitical tensions or a significant event such as a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or outbreak of violence in a country not currently under a Level 4 advisory. Such an event could prompt the State Department to issue a new advisory. For example, if a country with existing instability experiences a sudden coup or a major terrorist attack, it could quickly escalate to a Level 4 advisory.

Rationale:
- Given the current stability and lack of new advisories announced for June, the most likely outcome is that no new Level 4 advisories will be issued, which aligns with the status quo.
- However, the global political and security landscape can change rapidly, and unforeseen events can occur. Therefore, while the probability of "zero" is the highest, it is prudent to assign some probability to the issuance of one or more advisories.
- Historically, the issuance of multiple new Level 4 advisories in a single month is less common, so the probabilities for "two" and "greater than two" are lower.

Final probabilities:
Zero: 70%
One: 20%
Two: 7%
Greater than two: 3%

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "Zero." As of May 26, 2025, there have been no reports or announcements of new Level 4 advisories expected for June 2025. The most recent advisory was issued on May 12, 2025, for Venezuela, and the current list of Level 4 countries appears stable.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflict or a significant terrorist event in a country not currently under a Level 4 advisory. For example, if a country experiences a rapid deterioration in security due to a coup, outbreak of violence, or a major terrorist attack, the State Department might issue a new Level 4 advisory. Additionally, a severe natural disaster or health crisis could also prompt an advisory if it significantly impacts the safety and security of U.S. citizens.

[2025-05-26 02:16:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 days, as today is May 26, 2025, and the question pertains to the number of Level 4 travel advisories issued in June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "zero" new Level 4 travel advisories issued in June 2025. This is based on the current information that there have been no announcements or indications of new advisories being prepared for June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflict or a significant terrorist attack in a country not currently under a Level 4 advisory. For example, if a country experiences a rapid deterioration in security due to a coup, outbreak of war, or a major terrorist incident, the U.S. State Department might issue a new Level 4 advisory. Additionally, unforeseen natural disasters or health crises could also prompt new advisories.

Rationale:
1. **Status Quo Bias**: Given the current stability in the list of Level 4 advisories and the absence of any imminent threats or announcements, the most likely outcome is that no new advisories will be issued in June 2025. This aligns with the general tendency for the status quo to persist unless significant new information arises.

2. **Possibility of Change**: While the status quo is the most likely scenario, the world is unpredictable, and geopolitical events can change rapidly. Therefore, it is prudent to assign some probability to the issuance of one or more new advisories, albeit lower than the status quo outcome.

3. **Uncertainty and Moderate Probability**: Unexpected events can occur, leading to the issuance of multiple advisories. While unlikely, it is important to account for this possibility with a small probability.

Final probabilities:
- Zero: 70%
- One: 20%
- Two: 7%
- Greater than two: 3%
