(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend of Lee Jae-myung maintaining a strong lead continues, the margin of victory could remain around 21 percentage points or potentially increase slightly if his support grows further.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant scandal or legal issue involving Lee Jae-myung could emerge, drastically reducing his support and narrowing the margin of victory to single digits.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A major misstep or controversy involving Kim Moon-soo, or a successful last-minute campaign push by Lee Jae-myung, could increase his lead, resulting in a margin of victory exceeding 25 percentage points.
