[2025-05-27 04:04:40] INFO: Prediction: 0.85
[2025-05-27 04:04:40] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 16 days, as today is May 27, 2025, and the meeting is scheduled for June 12, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that the meeting will take place as scheduled on June 12, 2025, and the question will resolve as "Yes."

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome would involve technical difficulties similar to those experienced in 2024, where the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues or other unforeseen complications, preventing it from being fully completed on June 12, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is that the meeting proceeds smoothly on June 12, 2025, without any significant technical issues or interruptions, and is fully completed on that day.

Rationale: Given the information provided, the meeting is officially scheduled and confirmed by multiple sources. Although there were technical issues in 2024, there is no indication that similar problems are expected for the 2025 meeting. Companies often learn from past experiences and take steps to mitigate similar issues in the future. Therefore, the status quo outcome, which is that the meeting will occur as planned, should be given extra weight. 

Final answer: "Probability: 85%"

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the meeting will take place as scheduled on June 12, 2025. This is based on the official announcement and confirmation from GameStop's 2025 Proxy Statement and other sources.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve technical difficulties similar to those experienced in 2024, where the meeting is started but then postponed due to server issues or other unforeseen technical problems. If the meeting does not fully complete on June 12, 2025, it would resolve as No.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that the meeting proceeds smoothly without any technical issues, and all agenda items are addressed and completed on June 12, 2025, as planned.

Given the official scheduling and the lack of current indications of potential issues, the status quo heavily favors a Yes outcome. However, the past technical difficulties in 2024 introduce some uncertainty, though there is no current evidence to suggest a repeat of those issues.

Final Answer: "Probability: 85%"

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is that the meeting proceeds smoothly without any technical glitches or interruptions, and it is fully completed on June 12, 2025, as planned.

Rationale: Given the information available, the meeting is officially scheduled and confirmed by multiple sources to occur on June 12, 2025. While there is a precedent for technical issues from the previous year, there is no current indication that such problems will recur. The status quo, therefore, strongly suggests that the meeting will take place as planned. Good forecasters generally give more weight to the status quo, as changes are less common and the world tends to change slowly.

Final Answer: "Probability: 90%"

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "Yes." The meeting is officially scheduled to take place on June 12, 2025, as confirmed by GameStop's 2025 Proxy Statement and other official sources.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome could involve technical difficulties similar to those experienced in 2024, where the virtual meeting platform fails, and the meeting cannot be completed on June 12, 2025. If the meeting is postponed or rescheduled to a later date due to such issues, the outcome would be "No."

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is one where the meeting proceeds as planned on June 12, 2025, without any significant technical issues or interruptions. The meeting is fully completed on that date, as scheduled.

Given the information available, the status quo outcome is that the meeting will take place as planned. While there is a historical precedent for technical difficulties, there is no current indication that similar issues will occur this year. Therefore, the probability of the meeting successfully taking place on June 12, 2025, is relatively high.

Probability: 85%

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome is that the virtual meeting platform functions smoothly, the meeting proceeds as planned, and all agenda items are addressed without any interruptions or need for rescheduling.

Given the information available, the meeting is officially scheduled, and there is no current indication of expected technical issues. The status quo outcome is that the meeting will occur as planned. While there is a historical precedent for technical issues, the lack of current warnings or issues suggests that the meeting is likely to proceed without significant problems.
