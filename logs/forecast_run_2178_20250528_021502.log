[2025-05-28 02:15:19] INFO: Prediction: [Percentile(value=2.8, percentile=0.1), Percentile(value=3.0, percentile=0.2), Percentile(value=3.15, percentile=0.4), Percentile(value=3.2, percentile=0.6), Percentile(value=3.5, percentile=0.8), Percentile(value=4.0, percentile=0.9)]
[2025-05-28 02:15:19] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 4 weeks.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If the gas price remains stable at the current level, the average gas price on June 23, 2025, would be $3.19 per gallon.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the recent stability and slight decrease in gas prices, if this trend continues, the average gas price could slightly decrease to around $3.15 per gallon by June 23, 2025.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally expect gas prices to remain relatively stable in the short term, barring any major geopolitical or economic disruptions. Seasonal demand fluctuations and refinery maintenance schedules are typical factors considered, but no significant changes are anticipated in the immediate future.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant decrease in global oil demand due to a sudden economic downturn or a major breakthrough in alternative energy adoption could lead to a sharp drop in gas prices, potentially bringing the average price down to around $2.80 per gallon.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A geopolitical crisis in a major oil-producing region, leading to supply disruptions, could cause a spike in oil prices, which would likely result in higher gas prices, potentially reaching $4.00 per gallon or more.

[2025-05-28 02:15:19] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 4 weeks.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If the current price of $3.19 per gallon remains unchanged, the average gas price on June 23, 2025, would be $3.19.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The trend from March to May 2025 shows a slight increase from $3.10 to $3.19. If this trend continues, we might expect a modest increase, potentially reaching around $3.20 to $3.25 by June 23, 2025.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts might anticipate a slight increase in gas prices as the summer driving season typically leads to higher demand. However, the overall economic conditions, including inflation rates and crude oil prices, will significantly influence these expectations.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A sudden economic downturn or a significant decrease in crude oil prices due to geopolitical stability or increased production could lead to a decrease in gas prices, potentially dropping them to around $2.90 to $3.00.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A geopolitical crisis in a major oil-producing region or a natural disaster affecting oil refineries could lead to a sharp increase in gas prices, potentially pushing them to $3.50 or higher.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the recent stability in gas prices, if the trend of slight fluctuations around $3.19 continues, the price might remain close to $3.19, potentially varying slightly between $3.15 and $3.25.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts might expect a slight increase in gas prices as summer approaches due to increased travel demand, potentially pushing prices slightly higher. However, significant changes are not expected unless there are major disruptions in supply or geopolitical events.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A sudden increase in oil production or a significant decrease in demand due to economic downturns or advancements in alternative energy could lead to a drop in gas prices, potentially bringing the average down to around $2.80.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A geopolitical conflict in a major oil-producing region or a natural disaster affecting refinery operations could lead to a spike in gas prices, potentially pushing the average up to around $4.50.

However, no significant disruptions or changes in supply and demand dynamics are anticipated in the short term.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a sudden decrease in global oil prices due to geopolitical developments, such as a resolution to ongoing conflicts in oil-producing regions, leading to increased supply and lower prices.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could be a major geopolitical crisis or natural disaster affecting major oil-producing regions, leading to supply disruptions and a spike in global oil prices, which would subsequently increase gas prices in the US.
