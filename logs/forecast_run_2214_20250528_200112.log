[2025-05-28 20:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the resolution date is June 25, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, based on the current data and trends, is that Donald Trump's net approval on the issue of the economy is negative. The specific range that seems most likely given the current information is between -10.0% and -5.0%, as there is a general trend of disapproval but not overwhelmingly so. This is inferred from the fact that his overall approval rating is 43%, and his approval on specific economic policies is notably negative.

(c) An unexpected scenario that could result in a different outcome might involve a significant positive economic event or policy change that substantially improves public perception of Trump's handling of the economy. For example, if there were a sudden economic upturn, such as a major decrease in unemployment rates or a successful trade agreement that boosts economic confidence, this could lead to a more favorable net approval rating. Conversely, a significant negative event, such as a financial crisis or a major policy failure, could push the net approval even lower than current expectations.

Given the current data and trends, I will assign probabilities to each option as follows:

- Option_A ('<-15.0%'): 15%
- Option_B ('≥-15.0% and ≤-10.0%'): 25%
- Option_C ('>-10.0% and <-5.0%'): 40%
- Option_D ('≥-5.0%'): 20%
