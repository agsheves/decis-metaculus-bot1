[2025-05-29 14:01:26] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, from May 30, 2025, to June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as there is currently no announcement or confirmation of any country planning to sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: No new countries express interest or complete the necessary diplomatic processes to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June 2025. This could be due to a lack of immediate interest, geopolitical considerations, or other priorities taking precedence for potential signatory countries.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A country that has been in discussions or negotiations regarding the Artemis Accords finalizes its decision and signs the agreement in June 2025. This could be facilitated by ongoing diplomatic efforts, a strategic decision to align with the principles of the Accords, or a desire to participate in international space exploration initiatives.

Rationale: Given the steady growth in the number of signatories over the years and the recent signing by Norway in May 2025, there is a reasonable possibility that another country could sign the Accords in June 2025. However, without specific announcements or indications of upcoming signatories, the status quo outcome of "No" carries significant weight. The world often changes slowly, and without concrete evidence or announcements, the probability of a new signatory in June remains uncertain but possible.

Final answer: "Probability: 40%"

[2025-05-29 14:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, from May 30, 2025, to June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," as there is currently no announcement or confirmation of any country planning to sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: No new countries express interest or finalize the process to sign the Artemis Accords during June 2025. This could happen if potential signatories are still in discussions or negotiations, or if geopolitical or domestic issues delay their decision to join.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A country that has been in discussions to join the Artemis Accords finalizes its decision and signs the agreement in June 2025. This could be facilitated by diplomatic efforts, a desire to participate in international space exploration initiatives, or alignment with the principles of the Accords.

Rationale: Given the steady growth in signatories and recent signings in April and May 2025, there is a reasonable possibility that another country could sign in June 2025. However, without specific announcements or indications of imminent signings, the status quo outcome of "No" holds significant weight. The world often changes slowly, and while the trend suggests potential for new signatories, the lack of concrete information at this time leans towards a cautious forecast.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there is currently no announcement or confirmation of any country planning to sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: No new countries express interest or complete the necessary diplomatic processes to sign the Artemis Accords within the specified timeframe of June 2025. This could be due to geopolitical considerations, internal political dynamics, or a lack of immediate interest in space exploration initiatives.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A country that has been in discussions or negotiations to join the Artemis Accords finalizes its decision and signs the agreement in June 2025. This could be facilitated by diplomatic efforts, a strategic interest in aligning with the principles of the Accords, or a desire to participate in international space exploration efforts.

Rationale: Given the steady growth in signatories and recent signings, there is a possibility that another country could sign the Accords in June 2025. However, without specific announcements or indications of imminent signings, the status quo outcome of "No" should be given more weight. The world often changes slowly, and while the trend suggests potential for new signatories, the lack of concrete information at this moment leans towards a "No" outcome.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there is currently no announcement or confirmation of any country planning to sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve no new countries expressing interest or completing the necessary diplomatic processes to sign the Artemis Accords within the specified timeframe. This could be due to geopolitical factors, lack of interest, or prioritization of other international agreements.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a country that has been in discussions or negotiations regarding the Artemis Accords finalizing and signing the agreement in June 2025. This could be driven by diplomatic efforts, strategic interests in space exploration, or alignment with existing signatories.

Rationale: Given the steady growth in signatories and the recent addition of Norway, there is a possibility that another country could sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025. However, without specific announcements or indications of imminent signings, the status quo outcome of "No" carries significant weight. The world generally changes slowly, and without concrete evidence of a pending signing, it is prudent to lean towards the status quo.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as there is currently no announcement or confirmation of any country planning to sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that no new countries express interest or complete the process to become signatories of the Artemis Accords during June 2025. This could be due to geopolitical factors, lack of interest, or other priorities taking precedence for potential signatory countries.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that a country, possibly one with a developing space program or a strategic interest in aligning with the principles of the Artemis Accords, decides to sign the agreement in June 2025. This could be facilitated by diplomatic efforts, international collaborations, or a desire to participate in future space missions.

Rationale: Given the steady growth of signatories and the recent signing by Norway, there is a possibility that another country could sign in June 2025. However, without any current announcements or indications of a pending signature, the status quo suggests a "No" outcome. The world tends to change slowly, and while the trend has been for more countries to join, the lack of immediate information about a new signatory leans towards the status quo. Therefore, while there is potential for a "Yes" outcome, the probability should reflect the current lack of concrete evidence.
