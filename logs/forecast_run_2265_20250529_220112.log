[2025-05-29 22:01:42] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as June 2025 will determine the outcome based on clemency actions taken during that month.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Donald Trump grants executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025. This is based on the established pattern of frequent clemency actions, including a recent "flurry of pardons" at the end of May 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Donald Trump deciding to halt or significantly slow down his use of executive clemency in June 2025, perhaps due to political pressure, strategic considerations, or unforeseen events that cause him to change his approach.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Trump continuing his current pattern of frequent clemency grants, issuing pardons or commutations to more than 2 individuals in June 2025, consistent with his actions in previous months.

Rationale: Given the established pattern of frequent clemency grants, including multiple pardons in a single day at the end of May, and the historical context of Trump's willingness to use this power, the likelihood of him granting clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025 is high. The status quo suggests continuity in his behavior, and there is no current evidence to suggest a significant change in this pattern. Thus, the probability of a Yes outcome is higher than a No outcome.

Final answer: "Probability: 75%"

[2025-05-29 22:01:42] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the question pertains to clemency actions in June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be indeterminate at this moment since June has not yet started. However, based on the current pattern of frequent clemency actions, the status quo suggests a likelihood of further clemency grants in June.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve President Trump deciding to pause or significantly reduce the number of clemency grants in June 2025. This could be due to political pressure, legal challenges, or a strategic decision to focus on other priorities. Additionally, if there are no publicly disclosed clemency actions in June, the outcome would be No.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve President Trump continuing his current pattern of frequent clemency grants into June 2025. Given the recent "flurry of pardons" at the end of May and the high volume of clemency actions since January, it is plausible that Trump will grant clemency to more than 2 individuals in June, especially if he continues to use this power actively and publicly.

Given the established pattern of frequent clemency actions and the recent high-profile pardons, the likelihood of Trump granting clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025 appears high. However, since the future is inherently uncertain, and there is no specific information about June yet, some caution is warranted.

Probability: 75%

[2025-05-29 22:01:43] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the question pertains to clemency actions in June 2025, and today is May 29, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be that Trump continues to grant clemency at a high frequency, as evidenced by the recent "flurry of pardons" at the end of May 2025. This suggests a likelihood of more than 2 clemency actions in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Trump deciding to pause or significantly reduce his use of clemency powers in June 2025, perhaps due to political pressure, legal challenges, or strategic considerations. This could result in fewer than 3 clemency actions being publicly disclosed in June.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Trump maintaining or increasing his current pace of granting clemency, consistent with the pattern observed in May 2025. This could include issuing multiple pardons or commutations early in June, continuing the trend of frequent clemency actions.

Rationale: Given the established pattern of frequent clemency grants and the recent "flurry" of pardons, the status quo suggests a high likelihood of Trump granting clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025. While unforeseen events could alter this trajectory, historical behavior and recent actions indicate that a continuation of this pattern is more probable.

[2025-05-29 22:01:43] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the question pertains to clemency actions in June 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question would resolve as No, because as of today, there have been no clemency actions reported for June 2025.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the recent pattern of frequent clemency grants, Donald Trump decides to pause or significantly slow down his use of executive clemency in June 2025, possibly due to political pressure, strategic considerations, or other priorities. As a result, he grants clemency to 2 or fewer individuals in June 2025.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Continuing the pattern observed in the first half of 2025, Donald Trump maintains or increases his use of executive clemency in June 2025. He grants clemency to more than 2 individuals, possibly as part of a strategic move to reward allies, make a political statement, or respond to public or private appeals.

Rationale: Given the established pattern of frequent clemency actions, including a recent "flurry" of pardons at the end of May, it is reasonable to expect that Trump will continue to use his clemency powers actively in June. The status quo outcome would be a No, but the ongoing trend suggests a higher likelihood of a Yes outcome. However, since the world changes slowly most of the time, it is important to consider that unexpected factors could alter this trend.

[2025-05-29 22:01:43] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the question pertains to clemency actions in June 2025, and today is May 29, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Donald Trump has been actively granting clemency, with a recent "flurry of pardons" at the end of May 2025. Given this pattern, the status quo suggests a high likelihood of continued clemency actions into June, potentially resulting in more than 2 individuals receiving clemency.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected halt or significant slowdown in Trump's use of clemency powers. This could be due to political pressure, legal challenges, or a strategic decision to focus on other presidential priorities. If Trump does not grant clemency to more than 2 individuals in June, the outcome would be No.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Trump continuing his established pattern of frequent clemency grants. Given the recent activity and high volume of clemency actions since January 2025, it is plausible that Trump will grant clemency to more than 2 individuals in June, consistent with his recent behavior.

Rationale: The status quo indicates a strong pattern of frequent clemency grants, with over 1,500 individuals receiving clemency since January 2025 and multiple pardons issued in late May. Given this trend and the absence of any indications of a slowdown, it is reasonable to expect that Trump will continue to use his clemency powers actively in June. The world tends to change slowly, and without evidence to suggest a deviation from this pattern, the likelihood of a Yes outcome is high.
