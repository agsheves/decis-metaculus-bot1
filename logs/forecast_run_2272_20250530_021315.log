[2025-05-30 02:13:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline for determining disqualification is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," since none of the specified candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) have been disqualified as of May 30, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that none of the specified candidates face any legal challenges or disqualification proceedings before July 1, 2025, and they all remain eligible to run in the election.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that one or more of the specified candidates face legal challenges, such as issues with nationality, criminal charges, or other disqualifying factors, leading to their removal from the electoral list or becoming legally ineligible to run before July 1, 2025.

Given the current information, the status quo suggests a "No" outcome, as none of the specified candidates have been disqualified yet. However, political dynamics can change rapidly, especially in the context of elections. Despite this, the time frame is relatively short, and significant changes are less likely to occur within a month. Therefore, the probability of a "Yes" outcome is relatively low, but not impossible.

Final Answer: "Probability: 20%"

[2025-05-30 02:13:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline for determining the disqualification status is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is **No**, because as of May 30, 2025, none of the specified candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) have been disqualified.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that none of the specified candidates face any legal challenges, disqualifications, or changes in eligibility status before July 1, 2025. This would mean the current situation remains unchanged, and all these candidates remain eligible to run.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if any of the specified candidates are removed from the electoral list or become legally ineligible to run due to legal proceedings, changes in the electoral law, or other disqualifying events before July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the current status, none of the specified candidates have been disqualified, and there are no credible reports suggesting imminent disqualifications. The time frame until July 1, 2025, is relatively short, which makes significant changes less likely. However, political environments can be unpredictable, and legal challenges or changes in eligibility can occur quickly. Despite this, the status quo tends to persist in most situations, and thus the probability of a No outcome is higher.

[2025-05-30 02:13:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question resolves as **No**. This is because, as of now, none of the specified candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) have been disqualified.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that none of the specified candidates face any legal challenges or disqualifications before July 1, 2025. They all maintain their eligibility to run in the election without any changes to their legal status.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if any of the specified candidates are removed from the electoral list or become legally ineligible to run due to a court ruling, legal challenge, or any other official disqualification process before July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given that the status quo is that none of the specified candidates have been disqualified and considering that the world changes slowly most of the time, the likelihood of a sudden disqualification occurring within the next month is relatively low. However, political environments can be unpredictable, and legal challenges can arise unexpectedly. Still, the lack of current credible reports or indications of impending disqualifications for these candidates suggests that the status quo is likely to persist.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that none of the specified candidates face any legal challenges or disqualifications before July 1, 2025. This would mean that all of them remain eligible to run in the election as of that date.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if any of the specified candidates—Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo—are removed from the electoral list or become legally ineligible to run in the election under Ivorian law before July 1, 2025. This could occur due to legal challenges, changes in electoral law, or other unforeseen developments.

Given the current information, the status quo outcome is that none of the specified candidates have been disqualified. Since the world changes slowly most of the time, and there are no current credible reports suggesting imminent disqualification, the likelihood of a No outcome is higher. However, the political landscape can be unpredictable, and there is still a possibility of changes occurring within the next month.

[2025-05-30 02:13:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be **No**. Although Tidjane Thiam has been disqualified, he is not one of the candidates listed in the question. None of the specified candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) have been disqualified as of May 30, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that none of the specified candidates are disqualified or become legally ineligible to run in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election by July 1, 2025. This would mean that the current status quo remains unchanged.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is if any of the specified candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) are disqualified or become legally ineligible to run in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025. This could occur due to legal challenges, changes in eligibility criteria, or other unforeseen developments.

Rationale: Given that the status quo is that none of the specified candidates have been disqualified and considering the short time frame remaining until the resolution date, the probability of a No outcome is relatively high. However, political environments can be volatile, and unforeseen developments could still occur. Therefore, while extra weight is given to the status quo, some probability is allocated to a Yes outcome due to potential changes.

Final Answer: "Probability: 80%"
