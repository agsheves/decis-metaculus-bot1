[2025-05-30 10:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would likely be "No." This is because Keir Starmer's approval rating is currently very low, and there is no available data or confirmation that Shiguru Ishiba is the Japanese Prime Minister, nor any indication of his approval rating being lower than Starmer's.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Keir Starmer's approval rating remaining at its current low level or declining further, while Shiguru Ishiba either maintains a higher approval rating or is not confirmed as the Japanese Prime Minister, thus leaving the comparison moot.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a significant political scandal or crisis in Japan that dramatically lowers the approval rating of the sitting Japanese Prime Minister (whether it is Shiguru Ishiba or another leader) to below Keir Starmer's level. Alternatively, Starmer could experience a sudden surge in popularity due to successful policy initiatives or a major political victory.

Given the current information and the tendency for political approval ratings to change gradually, the status quo outcome of "No" is more likely. Keir Starmer's approval is at a historic low, and without concrete data on Shiguru Ishiba's approval or confirmation of his incumbency, it is reasonable to assume that Starmer's rating will not surpass that of a sitting Japanese Prime Minister.

Probability: 80%

[2025-05-30 10:01:48] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
There is approximately one month left until the outcome is known, as the resolution will be based on data available on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
The status quo outcome would likely be "No," as Keir Starmer's approval rating is currently very low, and there is no available data or confirmation that Shiguru Ishiba is the Japanese Prime Minister or that his approval rating is lower than Starmer's.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Keir Starmer's approval rating remains low or declines further due to ongoing dissatisfaction with his leadership. Meanwhile, Shiguru Ishiba either remains or becomes the Japanese Prime Minister, and his approval rating is not lower than Starmer's. Without any data to suggest Ishiba's approval is lower, the outcome would be "No."

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
Keir Starmer experiences a significant improvement in his approval rating due to a major political success or positive economic developments. Concurrently, Shiguru Ishiba becomes the Japanese Prime Minister and faces a severe political crisis or scandal, leading to a dramatic drop in his approval rating below Starmer's.

**Rationale:**  
Given the current information, Keir Starmer's approval rating is at a historic low, and there is no evidence that Shiguru Ishiba is the Japanese Prime Minister or that his approval rating is being tracked. The status quo strongly suggests a "No" outcome, as Starmer's low approval makes it unlikely for him to surpass a sitting Japanese Prime Minister's approval rating without significant changes. The world tends to change slowly, and without any indication of a major shift in either leader's circumstances, the likelihood of a "Yes" outcome is low.

**Final Answer:**  
Probability: 15%

[2025-05-30 10:01:48] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the resolution will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No." This is because Keir Starmer's approval rating is currently very low, with a net favourability of -46%, and there is no available data on Shiguru Ishiba's approval rating or confirmation that he is the Japanese Prime Minister. Without evidence of Ishiba's ratings being lower than Starmer's, the default assumption is that Starmer's rating is not higher.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Keir Starmer's approval rating remaining at its current low level or declining further, while Shiguru Ishiba either maintains a higher approval rating (if he is indeed the Prime Minister) or no data becomes available to suggest otherwise. Additionally, if another Japanese leader is in office with a higher approval rating than Starmer, the outcome would also be "No."

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would require a significant improvement in Keir Starmer's approval rating, potentially due to a successful policy initiative, a major political victory, or a scandal affecting the Japanese leadership. Alternatively, if Shiguru Ishiba or another Japanese leader were to face a severe crisis, leading to a drastic drop in their approval rating below Starmer's, this could also result in a "Yes" outcome.

Given the current information and the tendency for political situations to change slowly, the status quo outcome of "No" is more likely. Starmer's approval rating is at a historic low, and there is no evidence of Ishiba's ratings being lower.

[2025-05-30 10:01:51] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**
There is approximately one month left until July 1, 2025, when the outcome of the question will be determined.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**
The status quo outcome would likely be "No." Keir Starmer's approval rating is currently very low, with a net favourability of -46%. There is no data available for Shiguru Ishiba, and it is unclear if he is even the Prime Minister of Japan. Given the lack of evidence of Ishiba's incumbency or approval ratings, it is reasonable to assume that a sitting Japanese Prime Minister would likely have a higher approval rating than Starmer's current low rating.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**
Keir Starmer's approval rating remains low or declines further due to continued dissatisfaction among the British public. Meanwhile, Shiguru Ishiba, if he were to become Prime Minister, maintains a typical approval rating for a Japanese leader, which is generally higher than Starmer's current rating. Without any significant political upheaval or scandal affecting Ishiba, Starmer's approval rating remains lower.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**
Keir Starmer experiences a significant political turnaround, perhaps due to successful policy implementations or a major political event that boosts his popularity. Concurrently, Shiguru Ishiba, if he becomes Prime Minister, faces a major political scandal or crisis that drastically lowers his approval rating. This scenario would require a dramatic shift in public opinion for both leaders within the next month.

**Rationale:**
Given the current data, the status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome. Starmer's approval rating is at a historic low, and there is no evidence to suggest that Shiguru Ishiba is the Japanese Prime Minister or that his approval rating is being tracked. Even if Ishiba were to become Prime Minister, Japanese leaders typically maintain higher approval ratings than what Starmer currently holds. The likelihood of a dramatic shift in public opinion for both leaders within a month is low, given the slow nature of political changes.

**Final Answer:**
Probability: 85%

[2025-05-30 10:01:51] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-05-30 10:01:51] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
There is approximately one month left until July 1, 2025, when the approval ratings will be checked by Metaculus.

(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  
Based on the current information, the status quo outcome would resolve as "No." Keir Starmer's approval rating is notably low, with a net favourability of -46%. There is no available data on Shiguru Ishibaâ€™s approval rating, nor confirmation that he is the Japanese Prime Minister. In the absence of data for Ishiba, it is reasonable to assume that the sitting Japanese Prime Minister (likely Fumio Kishida) would have a higher approval rating than Starmer, given Starmer's current low ratings.

(c) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome:**  
Keir Starmer's approval ratings remain low or decline further due to continued dissatisfaction with his leadership among the British public. Meanwhile, the Japanese Prime Minister, whether Shiguru Ishiba or another leader, maintains a stable or higher approval rating, possibly due to effective governance or lack of significant political scandals. This scenario would result in Starmer having a lower approval rating than the Japanese Prime Minister, leading to a "No" outcome.

(d) **A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  
A significant political scandal or crisis emerges in Japan, severely impacting the approval ratings of the Japanese Prime Minister, whether it is Shiguru Ishiba or another leader. Concurrently, Keir Starmer manages to improve his public image and approval ratings through successful policy implementations or positive political developments in the UK. This scenario would result in Starmer having a higher approval rating than the Japanese Prime Minister, leading to a "Yes" outcome.

**Rationale:**  
Given the current data, the status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome due to Starmer's low approval ratings and the lack of information on Shiguru Ishiba's ratings or incumbency. The world tends to change slowly, and without significant developments, it is unlikely that Starmer's ratings will surpass those of the Japanese Prime Minister within the next month. Therefore, the probability of a "Yes" outcome is low.

**Final Answer:**  
Probability: 20%
