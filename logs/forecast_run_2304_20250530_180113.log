[2025-05-30 18:01:30] INFO: Prediction: 0.1
[2025-05-30 18:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is a "No" resolution, as there is currently no agreement announced between the IMF and Lebanon, and the earliest potential target for a staff-level agreement is late summer, which is after the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Lebanon continuing to face significant political and institutional obstacles that prevent the necessary reforms from being implemented. This would delay any agreement with the IMF beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. The resistance from private banks regarding banking secrecy laws and compensation plans for depositors could persist, further stalling progress.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would require a rapid acceleration in Lebanon's reform efforts and negotiations with the IMF. This could involve the new government making significant concessions or breakthroughs in key areas such as banking secrecy and depositor compensation. Additionally, an unexpected geopolitical or economic development could prompt both parties to expedite an agreement.

Given the current status and the historical pace of negotiations and reforms, the status quo outcome of "No" is more likely. The obstacles are significant, and the timeline for a potential agreement extends beyond the deadline. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome is relatively low.

Probability: 10%

[2025-05-30 18:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question would resolve as **No**, since there is currently no public announcement of an agreement between the IMF and Lebanon, and the earliest potential target for a staff-level agreement is after the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that Lebanon continues to face significant political and institutional obstacles, particularly regarding key reforms such as banking secrecy laws and compensation for depositors. The new government may struggle to implement these reforms quickly, and the IMF may remain hesitant to finalize an agreement without substantial progress. As a result, no agreement is announced by July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that the newly appointed Lebanese government accelerates its reform efforts and manages to make significant progress on the key issues identified by the IMF. This could involve passing necessary legislation and securing cooperation from private banks. In response to these efforts, the IMF might expedite negotiations and announce an agreement, possibly a staff-level agreement, before the July 1 deadline.

Rationale: Given the current status of negotiations and the slow progress on necessary reforms, the status quo outcome of **No** is more likely. The political and institutional challenges in Lebanon, combined with the IMF's cautious approach, suggest that reaching an agreement within the next month is improbable. While the new government has shown willingness to engage, the timeline is tight, and substantial changes would need to occur rapidly for a Yes outcome.

Final answer: "Probability: 15%"

[2025-05-30 18:01:33] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be a "No," since there is currently no agreement announced between the IMF and Lebanon, and the earliest potential timeline for a staff-level agreement is projected for late summer, which is after the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome involves the continuation of the current situation where key reforms required by the IMF remain unimplemented. Political and institutional obstacles, such as resistance from private banks to banking secrecy reforms and the lack of a comprehensive depositor compensation plan, persist. Consequently, no agreement is reached or announced before the July 1 deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a sudden breakthrough in negotiations between Lebanon and the IMF. This could occur if Lebanon's newly appointed government manages to expedite the implementation of key reforms, such as passing necessary banking sector laws and harmonizing exchange rates. Additionally, if both parties prioritize reaching an agreement due to external pressures or incentives, they might announce a preliminary or staff-level agreement before the deadline.

Rationale: Given the current status and the historical pace of reform and negotiation processes in Lebanon, the status quo outcome of "No" is more likely. The political and institutional challenges, along with the timeline suggested by officials, indicate that significant changes or announcements are unlikely to occur within the next month. While a breakthrough is possible, it would require rapid and coordinated action that has not been characteristic of Lebanon's recent dealings with the IMF.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

[2025-05-30 18:01:33] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be a "No" because there is currently no agreement announced, and the earliest potential target for a staff-level agreement is projected for late summer, which is after the July 1 deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve continued delays in implementing the necessary reforms required by the IMF, such as lifting banking secrecy and establishing a compensation plan for depositors. Political resistance from private banks and other stakeholders could further stall progress, preventing any agreement from being reached before the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would require a significant acceleration in reform efforts by the Lebanese government, possibly driven by increased political will or external pressure. This could lead to rapid progress in meeting the IMF's conditions, resulting in an expedited negotiation process and the announcement of an agreement before July 1, 2025.

Given the current situation, where key reforms are still pending and the timeline for an agreement is projected beyond the deadline, the likelihood of a Yes outcome is low. The status quo, which suggests a No outcome, is more probable, as changes of this magnitude typically take time and face significant obstacles.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be a **No**. As of now, there is no public announcement of an agreement between the IMF and Lebanon, and the earliest potential for a staff-level agreement is projected for late summer, which is after the July 1 deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve continued delays in Lebanon implementing the necessary reforms required by the IMF. Political and institutional obstacles, such as resistance to changes in banking secrecy laws and the lack of a clear plan to compensate depositors, could persist. Additionally, the newly appointed government may face internal challenges or external pressures that prevent them from reaching an agreement with the IMF before the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would require a rapid acceleration in reform implementation by the Lebanese government. This could involve unexpected breakthroughs in negotiations, such as a compromise on banking secrecy laws or a swift agreement on a depositor compensation plan. The IMF might also decide to expedite the agreement process due to geopolitical considerations or as a response to an urgent economic crisis in Lebanon.

Given the current information and the typical pace of international negotiations and reforms, the status quo outcome of No seems more likely. The obstacles to reaching an agreement are significant, and the timeline for a potential agreement extends beyond the deadline.
