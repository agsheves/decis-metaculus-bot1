[2025-05-30 22:01:39] INFO: Prediction: 0.1
[2025-05-30 22:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," since there is currently no indication of formal criminal charges, an arrest warrant, or any steps taken by law enforcement to arrest James Comey.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The congressional resolution condemning Comey remains a political statement without leading to any legal action. Legal experts continue to argue against the viability of prosecuting Comey for his social media posts, and no new evidence emerges that would prompt law enforcement to arrest him. As a result, Comey is not arrested by July 1, 2025.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: New evidence surfaces that provides a stronger basis for legal action against Comey, prompting federal or state prosecutors to file charges. An arrest warrant is issued, and law enforcement takes Comey into custody before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, the congressional committees advance their consideration of the resolution in a way that leads to legal proceedings and an arrest.

Rationale: Given the current information, the status quo outcome is more likely. There is skepticism from legal experts about the feasibility of prosecuting Comey based on the social media posts, and no formal legal actions have been initiated. The world tends to change slowly, and without significant new developments, the likelihood of an arrest seems low.

Final answer: "Probability: 10%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there is currently no evidence of an imminent arrest, no formal criminal charges, no arrest warrant, and no law enforcement action against James Comey.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that the situation remains unchanged, with no new evidence or legal actions emerging against Comey. The congressional resolution remains a political statement without leading to any legal proceedings or law enforcement actions. Legal experts' skepticism about the viability of prosecuting Comey for his social media posts holds true, and no charges are filed before the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that new evidence emerges that significantly strengthens the case for prosecuting Comey, prompting federal or state prosecutors to file charges. An arrest warrant is issued, and law enforcement takes action to arrest Comey before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, the congressional committees could advance their consideration of the resolution in a way that leads to legal proceedings and an arrest.

Rationale: Given the current information and the status quo, the probability of James Comey being arrested before the deadline appears low. The legal hurdles and expert skepticism suggest that a significant change in the situation would be required for an arrest to occur. The world tends to change slowly, and without new developments, the status quo outcome is likely to prevail.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there is currently no evidence of an imminent arrest, no formal criminal charges filed, no arrest warrant issued, and no law enforcement action taken against James Comey.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The congressional resolution remains a political statement without leading to any legal action. Legal experts' skepticism is validated, and no new evidence emerges that would warrant criminal charges or an arrest. As a result, Comey is not arrested by July 1, 2025.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: New evidence emerges that significantly strengthens the case against Comey, prompting federal or state prosecutors to file criminal charges. An arrest warrant is issued, and law enforcement takes action to arrest Comey before the deadline. Alternatively, an unrelated legal issue arises that leads to his arrest.

Rationale: Given the current information, the status quo outcome is heavily weighted towards "No." The legal and political processes involved typically take time, and the skepticism expressed by legal experts suggests that the likelihood of a sudden arrest is low. Additionally, the lack of any formal charges or arrest warrants further supports the status quo outcome. However, unforeseen developments could still occur, albeit with a lower probability.

Final answer: "Probability: 10%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there is currently no evidence of an imminent arrest, no formal charges filed, no arrest warrant issued, and no law enforcement action taken against James Comey.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the situation remaining unchanged, with no new evidence or legal actions taken against Comey. The congressional resolution remains a political statement without leading to any legal proceedings or law enforcement actions. Legal experts continue to argue against the viability of prosecuting Comey for his social media posts, and no further developments occur before the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve new evidence emerging that implicates Comey in a criminal act beyond the social media posts, prompting federal or state prosecutors to file charges. An arrest warrant could be issued, and law enforcement could take action to arrest Comey before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Alternatively, the congressional committees could advance their consideration of the resolution in a way that leads to law enforcement action.

Given the current information and the fact that the world changes slowly most of the time, the status quo outcome of "No" is more likely. The skepticism expressed by legal experts and the lack of any formal legal actions against Comey suggest that an arrest is not imminent. However, the possibility of new developments cannot be entirely ruled out.

Probability: 10%

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the situation remaining unchanged, with no new evidence or legal actions emerging against Comey. The congressional resolution remains a political statement without legal consequences, and legal experts' skepticism about prosecuting Comey for his social media posts continues to hold.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve new developments, such as the emergence of additional evidence that prompts federal or state prosecutors to file criminal charges against Comey. This could lead to the issuance of an arrest warrant and subsequent arrest before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Alternatively, a significant shift in the political or legal landscape could result in law enforcement taking action based on the congressional resolution or other factors.

Rationale: Given the current status quo, with no formal charges or arrest warrants and expert skepticism about the viability of prosecution, the likelihood of James Comey being arrested before July 1, 2025, appears low. The world tends to change slowly, and without significant new developments, the status quo outcome of "No" is more probable.
