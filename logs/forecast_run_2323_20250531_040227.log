[2025-05-31 04:02:51] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a "No" because the land border crossings between Benin and Nigeria's Kwara State remain closed, and there is no current indication of an imminent reopening.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued security threats from the militant group "Mahmuda" and ongoing concerns about illegal arms smuggling. These security issues might lead Benin to maintain its border closures to protect its national security and prevent illegal activities.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve successful diplomatic negotiations and technical cooperation between Benin and Nigeria, leading to improved border management and security measures. If the SIGMAT system and other initiatives demonstrate effectiveness in addressing security concerns, Benin might decide to reopen the borders to facilitate trade and regional integration.

Given the current situation and the short time frame until the deadline, the likelihood of a significant change in the status quo is low. The security concerns are a major factor driving the closure, and unless there is a swift and credible resolution to these issues, the borders are likely to remain closed.

[2025-05-31 04:02:51] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a **No**—Benin has not re-opened its closed land border crossings with Nigeria’s Kwara State.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The security concerns, particularly related to the militant group "Mahmuda" and illegal arms smuggling, remain unresolved. Benin continues to prioritize its national security and protectionist policies over reopening the border. Diplomatic efforts and technical initiatives like SIGMAT do not progress quickly enough to influence a change in policy before July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Diplomatic negotiations between Benin and Nigeria, possibly facilitated by ECOWAS, lead to a rapid improvement in security conditions and a mutual agreement on enhanced border management. The successful implementation of the SIGMAT system and other cooperative measures result in Benin feeling secure enough to reopen the border crossings before the deadline.

Rationale: Given the current situation and the short timeframe until July 1, 2025, the likelihood of a significant change in policy by Benin is low. The primary drivers of the border closure are security concerns and protectionist policies, which typically require substantial time and effort to address. While there are positive signs of cooperation and technical advancements, these are in early stages and unlikely to result in immediate policy changes. Thus, the status quo outcome of a No is more probable.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is a **No**—Benin has not re-opened its closed land border crossings with Nigeria’s Kwara State, and there is no indication that it will do so imminently.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve the continuation of security threats from the militant group "Mahmuda" and ongoing concerns about arms smuggling. If these security issues persist or escalate, Benin may maintain the border closures to protect its national security interests. Additionally, if the SIGMAT initiative and other diplomatic efforts do not progress swiftly enough, the border may remain closed past the deadline.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a significant diplomatic breakthrough between Benin and Nigeria, perhaps facilitated by ECOWAS or another regional body. If the security situation improves, and both countries reach an agreement on enhanced border management and trade facilitation, Benin might decide to reopen the border crossings. Rapid progress in the SIGMAT deployment and successful pilot phases could also contribute to a decision to reopen the borders.

Given the current situation and the slow nature of diplomatic and security-related changes, the status quo outcome of a No seems more likely. The short time frame until the deadline further supports this, as significant changes typically require more time to implement.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued security threats from the militant group “Mahmuda” and ongoing concerns about illegal arms smuggling. These issues could lead Benin to maintain the border closures to ensure national security and protect local agricultural markets from unregulated exports.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve successful diplomatic negotiations and technical cooperation between Benin and Nigeria, leading to improved border management and security measures. If these efforts, such as the SIGMAT system, quickly demonstrate effectiveness in addressing Benin's security and economic concerns, the government might decide to reopen the borders to facilitate trade and regional integration.

Given the short timeframe until the deadline and the current status quo, where the borders remain closed with no clear indication of reopening, the likelihood of a change occurring before July 1, 2025, seems low. The ongoing security concerns and protectionist policies are significant barriers to reopening. While diplomatic and technical efforts are positive signs, they are still in early stages and unlikely to result in immediate changes.

[2025-05-31 04:02:54] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 13 months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a **No**, as the land border crossings remain closed with no current indication of reopening.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued security threats from the militant group “Mahmuda” and ongoing concerns about arms smuggling. If these security issues persist or escalate, Benin may maintain the border closure to protect its national security interests. Additionally, if the protectionist policies regarding agricultural exports remain a priority for Benin, the borders may stay closed to prevent informal trade routes from undermining local markets.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve successful diplomatic negotiations and technical cooperation between Benin and Nigeria, leading to improved border management and security measures. If the SIGMAT system and other ECOWAS-supported initiatives prove effective in addressing security concerns and facilitating legitimate trade, Benin might feel confident enough to reopen the borders. Additionally, if there is significant economic pressure or incentives for Benin to resume trade with Nigeria, this could also prompt a reopening.

Rationale: Given the current situation, the status quo suggests a No outcome, as the borders remain closed with no immediate plans for reopening. The security concerns and protectionist policies are significant barriers that would need to be addressed for a reopening to occur. While there are positive signs of cooperation and technical improvements, these efforts are still in the early stages and may not lead to a swift resolution. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome before July 1, 2025, is relatively low, but not impossible, given the ongoing diplomatic efforts.
