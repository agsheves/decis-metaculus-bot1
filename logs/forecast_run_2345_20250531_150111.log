[2025-05-31 15:01:24] INFO: Prediction: 0.15
[2025-05-31 15:01:24] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 37 days, as the 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6–7, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as there is currently no public announcement or credible reporting indicating that a new country has been invited to join BRICS at the upcoming 17th Summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the 17th BRICS Summit proceeding without any new invitations for full membership being extended to previously not invited countries. The focus of the summit could remain on internal development and cooperation among existing members, aligning with Brazil's stated priorities as chair.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a decision by the BRICS members to invite a new country that has not been previously invited to become a full member. This could occur if there is a strategic or geopolitical shift, or if a consensus is reached among current members to expand the bloc further, possibly in response to global economic or political developments.

Given the current information and the tendency for international organizations to move slowly, the likelihood of a new country being invited as a full member at the 17th BRICS Summit appears low. The status quo suggests a focus on consolidating recent expansions and internal priorities.

Probability: 15%

[2025-05-31 15:01:25] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 37 days, as the 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6–7, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as there is currently no evidence or credible reporting suggesting that a new country will be invited to join BRICS as a full member at the 17th Summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The 17th BRICS Summit occurs without any new invitations for full membership being extended. The focus remains on internal development and cooperation among existing members, as indicated by Brazil's priorities as chair.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: In the weeks leading up to the 17th BRICS Summit, diplomatic negotiations result in a consensus among existing BRICS members to invite a new country, such as one of the partner countries from the 16th Summit, to join as a full member. This invitation is announced during or before the summit.

Rationale: Given the current information, the likelihood of a new country being invited to join BRICS as a full member at the 17th Summit appears low. The recent expansion and Brazil's focus on internal priorities suggest that further enlargement may not be a priority at this time. However, diplomatic developments can occur rapidly, and there is still a window of time for potential changes. Despite this, the status quo outcome should be given extra weight, as the world often changes slowly.

[2025-05-31 15:01:25] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 5 weeks, as the 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6–7, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as there is currently no public announcement or credible reporting indicating that a new country has been invited to join BRICS at the upcoming 17th Summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The 17th BRICS Summit focuses on internal development, cooperation, and the consolidation of the recently expanded membership. No new countries are invited to join as full members, and the summit concludes without any announcements regarding further expansion.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: In the weeks leading up to the summit, diplomatic negotiations among BRICS members lead to a consensus on inviting a new country that has not previously been invited. This decision is announced during the 17th BRICS Summit, resulting in the invitation of a new country as a full member.

Rationale: Given the current information and the focus of Brazil's presidency on internal development and cooperation, the likelihood of a new country being invited as a full member at the 17th BRICS Summit seems low. The recent expansion and the absence of any credible reports or announcements regarding further invitations suggest that the status quo outcome is more probable. However, the possibility of diplomatic negotiations leading to a new invitation cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if geopolitical dynamics shift or if there is a strategic interest in expanding the bloc further.

Final Answer: Probability: 20%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as there is currently no evidence or credible reporting indicating that a new country has been invited to join BRICS at the upcoming 17th Summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the 17th BRICS Summit proceeding without any new invitations being extended to previously not invited countries for full membership. The focus remains on internal development and cooperation among existing members, and no consensus is reached on further expansion.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a last-minute decision by the BRICS members to extend an invitation to a new country for full membership. This could occur if there is a strategic or geopolitical shift that prompts the existing members to unanimously agree on expanding the bloc, possibly influenced by global events or diplomatic negotiations leading up to the summit.

Rationale: Given the current information and the focus of the BRICS bloc on internal priorities rather than expansion, the status quo outcome is likely to be **No**. The world tends to change slowly, and without any current indications of impending invitations, the probability of a new country being invited is relatively low. However, the possibility of geopolitical shifts or strategic decisions cannot be entirely ruled out, so a small probability is still assigned to a Yes outcome.

Final Answer: "Probability: 15%"

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that the question resolves as **No**, since there is currently no evidence or credible reporting indicating that a new country will be invited to join BRICS as a full member at the 17th Summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is one where the BRICS summit proceeds as planned, focusing on Brazil's stated priorities of internal development and cooperation, without extending any new invitations for full membership to previously uninvited countries.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve a last-minute decision by the BRICS members to invite a new country for full membership, possibly due to strategic geopolitical considerations, lobbying by a candidate country, or a shift in priorities among the BRICS nations that favors further expansion.

Rationale: Given the current information and the lack of any announcements or credible indications of new invitations, the status quo strongly suggests a No outcome. Historically, changes in international organizations like BRICS tend to be slow and deliberate, and the recent focus has been on consolidating the expanded membership rather than further enlargement. While it is possible for unexpected developments to occur, the likelihood of such a significant change happening in the remaining time frame is relatively low.
