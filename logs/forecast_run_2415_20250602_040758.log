[2025-06-02 04:08:24] INFO: Prediction: 0.75
[2025-06-02 04:08:24] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 7 days, as the official NOAA report for May 2025 global temperatures is scheduled for release on June 9, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is unresolved, as the official NOAA report has not yet been published. However, based on current trends and forecasts, there is a strong indication that May 2025 could be among the hottest on record.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the global temperature for May 2025 not surpassing the previous record for the hottest May. This could occur if unexpected cooling events, such as volcanic eruptions or significant shifts in ocean currents, led to lower-than-anticipated global temperatures.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve May 2025 having the highest global temperature anomaly on record for the month of May. This could be driven by continued global warming trends, a strong El Ni√±o event, or other factors contributing to elevated temperatures worldwide.

Rationale: Given the persistent trend of record or near-record warmth in recent months and the strong forecast for above-average May temperatures, the likelihood of May 2025 being the hottest May on record is high. However, without the official NOAA report, the outcome remains unresolved. The status quo, based on current information, leans toward a Yes outcome, but it is prudent to consider the possibility of unforeseen events that could alter the result.

Final answer: "Probability: 75%"

[2025-06-02 04:08:24] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 7 days, as the NOAA report for May 2025 global temperatures is scheduled for release on June 9, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question remains unresolved. As of now, we do not have the official NOAA report confirming whether May 2025 is the hottest May on record.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the recent trend of record warmth and forecasts for above-average temperatures, the NOAA report for May 2025 could show that the global temperature anomaly did not surpass the previous record for the hottest May. This could occur if unexpected cooling events or data adjustments reveal lower temperatures than anticipated.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The NOAA report for May 2025 confirms that the global temperature anomaly for May 2025 was the highest on record, surpassing all previous Mays. This outcome would align with the recent trend of record warmth and the strong forecast for above-average temperatures globally.

Rationale: Given the persistent trend of record or near-record warmth, the strong forecast for above-average temperatures in May 2025, and the high probability of surpassing previous records, there is a strong likelihood that May 2025 could be the hottest May on record. However, as a forecaster, it's important to weigh the status quo outcome more heavily, which currently indicates uncertainty until the official NOAA report is released. The world changes slowly most of the time, and unforeseen factors could still influence the final outcome.

Final answer: "Probability: 70%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that the question remains unresolved, as the official NOAA report for May 2025 has not yet been published.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the current trends and forecasts, the global temperature data for May 2025 could reveal that it was not the warmest May on record. This could occur if unexpected cooling events, such as volcanic eruptions or significant changes in ocean currents, led to lower-than-anticipated global temperatures.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The global temperature data for May 2025 could confirm that it was the warmest May on record. This would align with the persistent trend of record or near-record warmth in recent months and the strong forecast for above-average May temperatures globally, as indicated by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.

Rationale: Given the recent trends of record warmth and the strong likelihood of continued above-average temperatures as forecasted, there is a high probability that May 2025 could be the hottest May on record. However, as a forecaster, it's important to consider the status quo and the possibility of unforeseen factors that could alter the outcome. Nonetheless, the indicators strongly suggest a "Yes" outcome, but the final determination awaits the official NOAA report.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Unresolved," as the official NOAA report has not yet been published. However, based on the current trends and forecasts, there is a strong indication that May 2025 could potentially be the hottest May on record.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unexpected cooling events or data revisions that show May 2025 temperatures were not as high as anticipated. For example, if there were significant cooling anomalies in key regions globally that offset the warmth in others, the overall global temperature might not surpass previous records.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the continuation of the current trend of record or near-record warmth, with May 2025 temperatures surpassing all previous records. This could be driven by widespread above-average temperatures globally, as suggested by the current outlooks and recent trends.

Rationale: Given the persistent trend of record warmth and the strong forecast for above-average temperatures, the likelihood of May 2025 being the hottest May on record is high. However, since the world changes slowly most of the time, the status quo outcome remains unresolved until the official data is released. The probability of a "Yes" outcome is bolstered by the recent trends and forecasts, but it cannot be confirmed until the NOAA report is published.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the official NOAA report indicating that May 2025 did not surpass previous records for the hottest May. This could occur if global temperatures were slightly lower than anticipated in key regions, or if other factors, such as unexpected cooling events, moderated the overall temperature anomaly.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the official NOAA report confirming that May 2025 was indeed the hottest May on record. This would be supported by the persistent trend of record or near-record warmth, the strong forecast for above-average temperatures, and the likelihood of continued global warming trends.

Rationale: Given the recent trends of record warmth and the strong forecast for above-average temperatures in May 2025, the probability of this month being the hottest May on record is quite high. However, as a forecaster, it is important to consider the status quo and the possibility of unexpected factors influencing the final outcome. The world changes slowly most of the time, and while the indicators are strong, the final determination awaits the official NOAA report.
