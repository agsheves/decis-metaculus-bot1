[2025-06-02 06:01:48] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The official year-over-year growth rate for US industrial production in May 2025 is expected to be released shortly after June 15, 2025. Today is June 2, 2025, so there are approximately two weeks left until the outcome is known.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the April 2025 figure, the year-over-year growth rate for May 2025 would be 1.5%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The current trend shows a slight increase from March to April (1.3% to 1.5%). If this trend continued, the May 2025 figure might slightly increase, potentially reaching around 1.6%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts and markets, including Trading Economics, expect the year-over-year growth rate for May 2025 to remain around 1.5%. The Conference Board's GDP growth forecast and ISM's manufacturing outlook suggest a subdued industrial environment, supporting this expectation.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome could involve a sudden economic shock, such as a geopolitical event or a significant supply chain disruption, causing industrial production to decline sharply.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome could involve a rapid recovery in global demand or a significant technological breakthrough in manufacturing, leading to a surge in industrial production.

[2025-06-02 06:01:49] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately two weeks, as the official data for May 2025 is expected to be released around mid-June 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the April 2025 data, the year-over-year growth in US industrial production for May 2025 would be 1.5%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The current trend suggests a slight increase in year-over-year growth, as seen from March to April 2025. If this trend continued, the May 2025 figure might be slightly above 1.5%, potentially around 1.6%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts and markets, including Trading Economics, expect the year-over-year growth for May 2025 to be around 1.5%, consistent with the April 2025 figure.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant geopolitical event or economic shock, such as a sudden escalation in trade tensions or a major financial crisis, could sharply reduce industrial production growth, potentially bringing it close to zero or even negative.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A rapid resolution of existing trade barriers or a sudden surge in domestic demand, possibly due to unexpected fiscal stimulus or a technological breakthrough, could boost industrial production growth significantly, potentially pushing it above 2.5%.

Given the current data and forecasts, the final answer is:

[2025-06-02 06:01:50] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
The official year-over-year growth rate for US industrial production in May 2025 will be released after June 15, 2025. Today is June 2, 2025, so there are approximately two weeks until the outcome is known.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed:**

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued:**  
The current trend shows a slight increase from 1.3% in March to 1.5% in April. If this trend continued, the May 2025 growth rate might be slightly above 1.5%, but not significantly higher given the overall subdued industrial environment.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets:**  
Experts and markets, including Trading Economics and macro models, expect the year-over-year growth rate for industrial production in May 2025 to be around 1.5%. The Conference Board's GDP growth forecast and the ISM's manufacturing outlook suggest a generally modest industrial growth environment.

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**  
An unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome could involve a sudden economic shock, such as a geopolitical event or a significant supply chain disruption, causing a sharp decline in industrial production.

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**  
A high outcome could result from an unexpected surge in demand for US-manufactured goods, possibly due to a rapid economic recovery in key trading partners or a major government stimulus package targeting industrial sectors.

Given the current data and forecasts, I will set a wide confidence interval to account for uncertainties:
