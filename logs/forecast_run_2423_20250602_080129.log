[2025-06-02 08:01:46] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 13 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after June 15, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is a Yes. Current data shows a 1.5% year-over-year increase in industrial production for April 2025, and forecasts suggest this positive trend will continue into May 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a sudden and unexpected economic shock, such as a significant geopolitical event, a major natural disaster, or an abrupt and severe increase in tariffs or raw material costs that severely disrupts industrial production in May 2025. Such an event would need to cause a rapid decline in production levels, leading to a year-over-year contraction.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of current trends, where industrial production maintains its positive year-over-year growth. This could be supported by stable economic conditions, gradual improvements in manufacturing activity, or successful adaptations by industries to mitigate the impacts of tariffs and rising raw material costs.

Given the current data and forecasts, the status quo outcome is more likely, as the world tends to change slowly and there are no immediate indicators of a significant downturn in industrial production. Therefore, the probability of a positive year-over-year growth for May 2025 remains high.

Probability: 85%

[2025-06-02 08:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two weeks, as the data for May 2025 will be checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that US industrial production will have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. Current data shows a 1.5% year-over-year increase as of April 2025, and forecasts suggest this trend will continue into May 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve a sudden and significant negative shock to the industrial sector, such as an unexpected escalation in tariffs, a major supply chain disruption, or a sharp increase in raw material costs that severely impacts production levels in May 2025. Such a shock would need to be severe enough to cause a contraction in industrial production compared to May 2024.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current trend, where industrial production maintains its positive year-over-year growth. This could be supported by stable economic conditions, gradual improvements in manufacturing activity, and no major negative shocks affecting the industrial sector.

Given the current data and forecasts, the status quo outcome is a positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. The world tends to change slowly, and there are no immediate indicators of a significant downturn in industrial production. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome is high.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be Yes. As of the latest data from April 2025, US industrial production is growing at a 1.5% year-over-year rate, and forecasts suggest this positive trend will continue into May 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve unexpected economic shocks or disruptions in early June 2025, such as a significant escalation in tariffs, a sudden spike in raw material costs, or a major geopolitical event that severely impacts industrial production. Additionally, a drastic revision of the April 2025 data to show a contraction could also contribute to a negative year-over-year growth for May 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the continuation of current trends, with industrial production maintaining or slightly increasing its current growth rate. This could be supported by stable economic conditions, no further escalation in tariffs, and a gradual improvement in manufacturing activity as indicated by positive new orders and employment expectations.

Given the current data and forecasts, the status quo outcome is a positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. The world tends to change slowly, and there are no strong indications of a significant downturn in the immediate future. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome is high.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that the US industrial production will have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. This is based on the current 1.5% year-over-year growth rate observed in April 2025 and the forecasts projecting continued positive growth.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected and significant economic shock occurring in early May 2025, such as a major geopolitical event, a sudden and severe supply chain disruption, or an abrupt and substantial increase in tariffs or raw material costs. Such events could cause a rapid contraction in industrial production, leading to a negative year-over-year growth rate for May 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be the continuation of the current trends, where industrial production maintains its positive growth trajectory. This could be supported by stable economic conditions, gradual improvement in manufacturing activity, and the absence of any major negative shocks. Additionally, if new orders and employment in the manufacturing sector continue to improve, this could further bolster industrial production growth.

Given the current data and forecasts, the status quo outcome is a positive year-over-year growth for May 2025. The world tends to change slowly, and there are no immediate indicators of a significant downturn. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome is relatively high.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected and significant economic shock within the next two weeks, such as a major geopolitical event, a sudden and severe supply chain disruption, or an abrupt and substantial increase in tariffs or raw material costs. Such events could lead to a rapid contraction in industrial production, reversing the current positive growth trend.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current economic conditions and trends. This includes stable or slightly improving industrial production, as suggested by forecasts and macroeconomic models. Even with weak manufacturing activity, the overall industrial production index could maintain positive growth due to contributions from other sectors or slight improvements in manufacturing.

Given the current data and forecasts, and considering that the world changes slowly most of the time, the status quo outcome is more likely. Therefore, the probability of a Yes outcome is high.
