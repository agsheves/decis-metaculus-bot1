[2025-06-02 16:01:40] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 11 days, as the film is scheduled for release on June 13, 2025, and the opening weekend results will be available shortly after.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would likely be in the range of $65-75 million, based on the earlier conservative projections from May 2, 2025.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be in the range of $80-100 million, as the most recent projections from May 23, 2025, suggest.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets are currently leaning towards an opening weekend gross of $80-100 million, reflecting increased momentum and audience interest as the release date approaches.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve negative reviews or poor word-of-mouth following early screenings, which might deter audiences and result in an opening weekend gross below $65 million.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve extremely positive reviews and strong word-of-mouth, coupled with a highly successful marketing push, leading to an opening weekend gross exceeding $100 million.

Given the information and considering the potential for unexpected scenarios, I will provide a range of potential outcomes with a wide confidence interval:
