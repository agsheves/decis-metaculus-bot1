[2025-06-02 18:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome is already known as of June 2, 2025, since the data for May 2025 should be available.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the previous year, the year-over-year increase would be 0%. However, this is unlikely given the trends and forecasts.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Based on the available information, national trends suggest a year-over-year increase of 2.1% to 4% for multifamily and single-family rents. For Denver, considering the prevalence of rental concessions, the increase might be slightly lower than the national average.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts expect national rent increases of 2.1% to 3.2% for multifamily and single-family homes, respectively. Denver's specific factors, such as rental concessions, might moderate these increases.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant economic downturn or a sudden increase in housing supply in Denver could lead to a lower-than-expected increase or even a decrease in rents.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in demand for housing in Denver, possibly due to a large influx of new residents or a booming local economy, could result in a higher-than-expected increase in rents.

[2025-06-02 18:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome should already be known, as it is now June 2, 2025, and the data for May 2025 should be available.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the previous year, the year-over-year increase would be 0%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Based on the national trends provided, if Denver followed the national average for multifamily rents (2.1% to 2.9%) and single-family rents (3.2% to 4%), we might expect a similar range for Denver. However, given the specific mention of increasing rental concessions in Denver, the effective increase might be on the lower end of this range.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts expect national rent increases in the range of 2.1% to 4%, with Denver potentially experiencing moderated growth due to rental concessions.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A sudden economic downturn or a significant increase in housing supply in Denver could lead to a decrease in rents or a very minimal increase.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A rapid economic recovery or a significant increase in demand for housing in Denver, possibly due to migration or job growth, could lead to a higher-than-expected increase in rents.

[2025-06-02 18:01:32] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is essentially zero, as today is June 2, 2025, and the data for May 2025 should be available soon or is already available.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be a continuation of the recent trends observed in the Denver rental market. Given the recent report of a $70 drop in rents, this suggests a potential decrease or stabilization in rental prices.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued, considering national trends and Denver's specific conditions, might suggest a modest increase in rents. Nationally, rents are projected to rise by 2.1% to 3.2% for multifamily and single-family homes, respectively. However, Denver's increase in rental concessions could moderate these increases.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets, based on the provided information, suggest a modest increase in rents. National forecasts indicate increases in the range of 2.1% to 4%, but Denver's unique market conditions, including high rental concessions, might lead to a lower increase than the national average.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a significant economic downturn in Denver, leading to increased vacancies and further rental concessions, resulting in a year-over-year decrease in rents.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome might involve a sudden surge in demand for housing in Denver due to an influx of new residents or a booming local economy, leading to a sharp increase in rents despite current trends.

[2025-06-02 18:01:33] INFO: Reasoning: To address the interview question, let's go through the structured forecasting process:

(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**
The outcome is already known as of June 2, 2025, since the data for May 2025 should be available.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed:**
If nothing changed from the previous year, the year-over-year increase in rent would be 0%.

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued:**
Based on the national trends provided, single-family rents are expected to rise by 3.2% and multifamily rents by 2.1% in 2025. If Denver follows the national trend, the increase could be within this range. However, given the specific mention of rental concessions in Denver, the effective increase might be slightly lower.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets:**
Experts expect national rent increases of 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily homes. The Denver market might experience a slightly lower increase due to higher rental concessions, potentially moderating the effective rent growth.

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**
An unexpected economic downturn or increased housing supply in Denver could lead to a lower-than-expected rent increase, or even a decrease, as landlords might offer more concessions or reduce rents to attract tenants.

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**
A sudden surge in demand for housing in Denver, possibly due to an influx of new residents or a booming local economy, could result in a higher-than-expected rent increase as competition for available units intensifies.

Given the information and considering the potential variability in the Denver market, here is the final forecast:

```
Percentile 10: -1
Percentile 20: 0
Percentile 40: 1.5
Percentile 60: 2.5
Percentile 80: 3.5

[2025-06-02 18:01:34] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome is already known as of June 2, 2025, since the question pertains to the year-over-year increase in rent for May 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the previous year, the year-over-year increase would be 0%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Based on the national trends provided, if Denver followed the national multifamily rental trend of 2.9% and single-family rental trend of 4%, the increase might be around 3-4%. However, considering the specific context of Denver with increased rental concessions, the effective increase might be slightly lower.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts expect national rent increases of 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily homes in 2025. For Denver, the presence of rental concessions suggests that the effective rent increase might be moderated compared to the headline figures.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant economic downturn or a sudden increase in housing supply in Denver could lead to a decrease or minimal increase in rents, potentially resulting in a year-over-year change of 0% or even negative.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in demand for housing in Denver, perhaps due to a major company relocating there or a significant population influx, could drive rents up significantly, resulting in a year-over-year increase well above the national average, potentially in the range of 5-6% or higher.
