[2025-06-02 20:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is essentially zero, as the question is set to resolve based on data available as of June 2, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be a 0% increase, assuming no year-over-year change in rent prices.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be around a 3.2% increase for single-family homes and a 2.1% increase for multifamily units, based on Zillow's projections.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest a moderate increase in rent prices, with single-family homes expected to see a slightly higher increase than multifamily units due to strong demand.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a significant economic downturn in Orlando, leading to decreased demand for rentals and potentially a decrease in rent prices.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could be a sudden surge in population growth in Orlando, leading to increased demand for rentals and a higher-than-expected increase in rent prices.

Based on the information and analysis, my final answer is:

[2025-06-02 20:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome is known as of June 2, 2025, so the time left is zero days.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the current forecast, the year-over-year increase in rent for May 2025 would likely be around 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily units.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend of slight monthly increases continues, the year-over-year increase might be slightly higher than the current forecast, possibly around 3.5% for single-family homes and 2.3% for multifamily units.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts and markets expect a moderate increase in rents due to strong demand for single-family rentals, despite an increase in rental supply. The forecasted increase is around 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily units.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant economic downturn or a sudden oversupply of rental units could lead to stagnant or even decreasing rents, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 0% or less.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A strong economic recovery or a sudden surge in demand for rental properties, possibly due to population growth or a decrease in homeownership rates, could lead to a higher-than-expected increase in rents, potentially exceeding 5%.

[2025-06-02 20:01:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome is already known as of June 2, 2025, since the data for May 2025 should be available.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the current rent levels, the year-over-year increase would be 0%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Based on the assistant's information, the current trend suggests a moderate increase in rent prices. If the trend of a 3.2% increase for single-family homes and a 2.1% increase for multifamily units continued, the overall year-over-year increase might be around 2.5% to 3.0%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts expect a moderate increase in rent prices, with a focus on single-family homes seeing a slightly higher increase due to strong demand. The expectation seems to be around a 2.1% to 3.2% increase.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant increase in rental supply, possibly due to a surge in housing permits or new construction projects, could lead to a lower-than-expected increase in rent prices, potentially even resulting in a decrease.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in demand for rentals, perhaps due to an influx of new residents or a significant economic boom in Orlando, could drive rent prices up more than expected, resulting in a higher year-over-year increase.

[2025-06-02 20:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:  
Since today is June 2, 2025, the data for May 2025 should be available soon, likely within a few weeks. The outcome will be known once Zillow releases their Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for May 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:  
If nothing changed from the current situation, the year-over-year increase in rent would likely be around the current forecasted figures. Given the forecasted increases of 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily units, a blended rate might be around 2.5%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:  
If the current trend of moderate rent increases continues, the year-over-year increase might align closely with the forecasted figures, potentially around 2.5% to 3%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts and markets expect a moderate increase in rents, with forecasts suggesting a 3.2% increase for single-family homes and a 2.1% increase for multifamily units. The expectation is that strong demand for single-family rentals will keep rent growth stable despite increased rental supply.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:  
An unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome could involve a significant economic downturn in Orlando, causing a decrease in demand for rentals. This could be triggered by a major employer leaving the area or a sudden increase in unemployment, leading to a year-over-year rent increase of around 0% or even a decrease.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:  
An unexpected scenario leading to a high outcome could involve a sudden surge in demand for rentals due to a large influx of new residents or a major event attracting people to the area. This could result in a year-over-year rent increase significantly higher than expected, potentially around 5% or more.

[2025-06-02 20:01:41] INFO: Reasoning: Before providing the final answer, let's go through the required steps:

(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  
Since today is June 2, 2025, the data for May 2025 should be available soon, if not already.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed:**  
If nothing changed from the current situation, we might expect a modest increase in rent due to the stable demand for single-family rentals. The current forecast suggests a 3.2% increase for single-family homes and a 2.1% increase for multifamily units.

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued:**  
If the current trend of stable or slightly increasing rents continues, we might see an increase close to the forecasted values of 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily units.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets:**  
Experts expect a moderate increase in rent prices, with a focus on single-family homes due to strong demand. The forecasted increase is around 3.2% for single-family homes and 2.1% for multifamily units.

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**  
An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome could be a sudden economic downturn or a significant increase in rental supply that outpaces demand, leading to a decrease or minimal increase in rent prices.

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**  
A high outcome could occur if there is a sudden surge in demand for rentals due to factors like population growth, a decrease in homeownership affordability, or a significant influx of people moving to Orlando, leading to a higher-than-expected increase in rent prices.

Now, considering these factors, I will provide the final answer with wide confidence intervals:

Percentile 20: 1.5
Percentile 40: 2.0
Percentile 60: 2.5
