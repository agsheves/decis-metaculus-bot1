[2025-06-03 00:03:02] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome is already known as of June 3, 2025, since the data for May 2025 has been released.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the current data, the year-over-year increase in rent in Chicago, IL, for May 2025 would be +2.4%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend of a moderate increase continues, the year-over-year increase could remain around +2.4%, potentially slightly higher or lower depending on local market conditions.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts and markets expect a moderate increase in rents, with national forecasts projecting single-family rents to rise by 3.2% and multifamily rents by 2.1%. Chicago's increase aligns with these projections.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome could involve a sudden economic downturn or a significant increase in housing supply, leading to decreased demand and lower rent increases.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome could involve a rapid economic recovery, increased demand for housing, or legislative changes that restrict housing supply, leading to higher rent increases.
