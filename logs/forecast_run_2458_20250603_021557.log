[2025-06-03 02:16:12] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is very short, as it is currently June 3, 2025, and the data for May 2025 should be available soon.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If the current rent level of $3,063 remains the same as the previous year, the year-over-year increase would be 0%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Assuming a modest increase in line with the national forecast for single-family and multifamily rents, we might expect an increase in the range of 2.1% to 3.2%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts expect rent increases to be lower in 2025 due to increased supply, but strong demand for single-family rentals may keep rent growth stable. Nationwide projections suggest increases around 2.1% to 3.2%.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant economic downturn or a sudden increase in rental supply in San Diego could lead to stagnant or even decreasing rents, resulting in a year-over-year increase close to 0% or negative.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A sudden surge in demand for rentals in San Diego, perhaps due to a large influx of new residents or a major economic boom, could drive rents up significantly, resulting in a year-over-year increase well above the national average, potentially exceeding 5%.

[2025-06-03 02:16:13] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately one month, as the data for May 2025 is expected to be available shortly after the end of May.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be difficult to determine precisely without specific historical data for San Diego's rent changes. However, given the broader context of national trends and San Diego's historical rent growth, a conservative estimate might be around 3-4% year-over-year increase, assuming stability in the market.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued, based on the national forecast of single-family and multifamily rent increases (3.2% and 2.1%, respectively), might suggest a similar range for San Diego. However, San Diego's market dynamics, such as demand and supply factors, could lead to a slightly higher increase, possibly around 4-5%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets, as indicated by Zillow's forecast, suggest moderate rent growth due to increased supply but stable demand. This aligns with a year-over-year increase in the range of 3-5% for San Diego, considering its unique housing market pressures and historical trends.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a significant increase in housing supply, such as a surge in new apartment buildings or policy changes that make it easier to build affordable housing, leading to a year-over-year increase of around 1-2%.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a sudden surge in demand due to economic growth in the region, attracting more residents and driving up rents significantly, resulting in a year-over-year increase of 6-8%.

[2025-06-03 02:16:14] INFO: Reasoning: (a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**
The outcome is expected to be known once the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for May 2025 is accessed and reported, which could be any time after June 2025. As of June 3, 2025, the data is not yet available, so it could be a matter of days or weeks until it is published.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed:**
If nothing changed from the current average rent of $3,063, the year-over-year increase would be 0%. However, this is highly unlikely given typical fluctuations in the rental market.

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued:**
If we assume a modest increase in rents similar to the national trends, we might expect an increase in the range of 2% to 3%. This is based on the nationwide forecasts of 3.2% for single-family rents and 2.1% for multifamily rents.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets:**
Experts expect a nationwide rent increase of around 2.1% to 3.2% for 2025, with San Diego potentially experiencing a similar or slightly higher increase due to its unique market conditions and demand pressures.

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**
An unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome could be a sudden economic downturn or a significant increase in housing supply in San Diego, causing rents to stagnate or even decrease slightly.

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**
A high outcome could occur if there is an unexpected surge in demand for housing in San Diego, perhaps due to a large influx of new residents or a significant economic boom in the area, driving rents up significantly.

Based on the information and analysis, here is the final forecast:

[2025-06-03 02:16:14] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: The outcome is expected to be known once the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for May 2025 is accessed and reported by Metaculus Admins. As of June 3, 2025, this could happen imminently, but the exact timing is uncertain.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If there were no changes from the current rent of $3,063, the year-over-year increase would be 0%.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given that Zillow's forecast projects a 3.2% increase for single-family rents and a 2.1% increase for multifamily rents nationwide in 2025, a reasonable estimate for San Diego could be within this range. However, San Diego's specific dynamics might lead to a slightly different outcome. Assuming a midpoint of these forecasts, a continuation of the trend might suggest a year-over-year increase of around 2.65%.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts expect rent increases to be somewhat moderated in 2025 due to increased supply, but strong demand, particularly for single-family rentals, could sustain some growth. The upward revision of the single-family rent forecast indicates a cautious optimism for rent growth.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A significant economic downturn or a sudden increase in housing supply in San Diego could lead to stagnant or even decreasing rents, resulting in a year-over-year increase close to 0% or even negative.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A surge in demand due to an influx of new residents or a sudden decrease in housing supply (e.g., due to regulatory changes or natural disasters) could lead to a sharp increase in rents, potentially resulting in a year-over-year increase of 5% or more.

[2025-06-03 02:16:15] INFO: Reasoning: To approach this forecasting question, let's break down the components:

(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**
   - The outcome will be known once the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) data for San Diego, CA for May 2025 is published and accessed. As of June 3, 2025, this data should be available soon, typically within a few weeks after the end of the month.

(b) **The outcome if nothing changed:**
   - If nothing changed from the current average rent of $3,063, the year-over-year increase would be 0%. However, this is highly unlikely given historical trends and market dynamics.

(c) **The outcome if the current trend continued:**
   - Based on the national forecast, if San Diego follows the national trend for single-family rents (3.2% increase) and multifamily rents (2.1% increase), we might expect a similar range for San Diego. However, San Diego's specific market conditions, such as demand and supply dynamics, could cause deviations.

(d) **The expectations of experts and markets:**
   - Experts expect rent increases to be lower in 2025 compared to previous years due to increased supply. However, strong demand, particularly for single-family rentals, is expected to keep rent growth stable. This suggests a moderate increase, likely in the range of 2% to 4%.

(e) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**
   - A significant increase in housing supply, such as a surge in new apartment buildings or policy changes that encourage more accessory dwelling units (ADUs), could lead to a lower-than-expected rent increase or even a decrease.

(f) **A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**
   - A sudden increase in demand due to economic growth, an influx of new residents, or a reduction in housing supply (e.g., due to natural disasters or policy changes restricting new developments) could lead to a higher-than-expected rent increase.

Given these considerations, here's the forecast with wide confidence intervals to account for uncertainties:
