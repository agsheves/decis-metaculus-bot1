[2025-06-03 06:01:38] INFO: Prediction: 0.6
[2025-06-03 06:01:38] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 12 to 14 days, as the G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15–17, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Unknown," as there is currently no public confirmation or denial of Zelenskyy's attendance at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Zelenskyy deciding not to attend due to security concerns, political reasons, or logistical challenges. Alternatively, a significant escalation in the conflict with Russia or a domestic crisis in Ukraine could prevent him from traveling.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve an official announcement confirming Zelenskyy's attendance in person. This could be influenced by successful diplomatic negotiations, assurances of security, or a strategic decision to strengthen Ukraine's ties with the G7 countries.

Rationale: Given the importance of Ukraine in G7 discussions and the historical pattern of inviting Zelenskyy to such summits, there is a reasonable likelihood that he will attend. However, the lack of current confirmation and potential uncertainties related to security and logistics introduce some doubt. The status quo outcome remains "Unknown," but the probability of a Yes outcome is higher than a No outcome due to the ongoing engagement between Ukraine and the G7.

Final answer: "Probability: 60%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "Unknown," as there is currently no public confirmation or denial of President Zelenskyy's attendance at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Zelenskyy deciding not to attend the summit due to security concerns, domestic priorities, or diplomatic reasons. Alternatively, a significant escalation in the conflict with Russia might require his presence in Ukraine, preventing him from traveling.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Zelenskyy confirming his attendance in person, possibly due to a diplomatic breakthrough or a strategic decision to strengthen ties with G7 countries. This could be announced shortly before the summit, aligning with his previous engagements with international leaders.

Rationale: Given the ongoing importance of Ukraine in international discussions and Zelenskyy's previous participation in G7 summits, there is a reasonable likelihood that he will attend, especially if security conditions allow. However, the lack of current confirmation and potential for unforeseen developments suggest some uncertainty. The status quo outcome is "Unknown," but the probability leans towards a Yes outcome due to the historical context and diplomatic importance.

Probability: 60%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "Unknown," as there is currently no confirmation or denial of President Zelenskyy's attendance at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a credible announcement from the Ukrainian government or the G7 organizers stating that President Zelenskyy will not attend the summit in any capacity, either due to security concerns, scheduling conflicts, or other diplomatic reasons.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve an official confirmation from either the Ukrainian government or the G7 organizers that President Zelenskyy will attend the summit in person. This could be announced through a press release, a statement from President Zelenskyy himself, or coverage by a reputable news outlet.

Rationale: Given the current lack of information and the historical context of Ukraine's involvement in G7 discussions, there is a reasonable likelihood that President Zelenskyy could attend the summit, especially considering the ongoing relevance of Ukraine to G7 discussions. However, the absence of any confirmation at this point suggests caution. The status quo outcome is "Unknown," and changes in the situation could lead to either a Yes or No outcome. Considering the slow pace of change and the importance of Ukraine to the G7, I will assign a moderate probability to Zelenskyy's attendance.

Final answer: "Probability: 60%"

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is "Unknown" because there is currently no public confirmation or denial of President Zelenskyy's attendance at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve a credible announcement or report indicating that President Zelenskyy will not attend the G7 Summit in any capacity, possibly due to security concerns, logistical challenges, or a decision to focus on domestic issues in Ukraine.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve an official announcement from the Ukrainian government or the G7 organizers confirming that President Zelenskyy will attend the summit in person. This could be motivated by the importance of Ukraine's role in international discussions, the opportunity for direct diplomatic engagement, or a strategic decision to demonstrate Ukraine's active participation in global affairs.

Rationale: Given the current lack of confirmation and the historical context of Zelenskyy's involvement in G7 discussions, there is a reasonable possibility that he may attend, especially considering the ongoing relevance of Ukraine to G7 topics. However, without any official confirmation, the status quo remains uncertain. Good forecasters often weigh the status quo heavily, as changes in international diplomatic events can be slow and unpredictable.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "Unknown," as there is currently no public confirmation or denial of President Zelenskyy's attendance at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve President Zelenskyy deciding not to attend the summit due to security concerns, a sudden escalation in the conflict with Russia, or other pressing domestic issues that require his presence in Ukraine. Alternatively, logistical issues or diplomatic disagreements could prevent his attendance.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve an official announcement confirming President Zelenskyy's attendance in person at the G7 Summit. This could be facilitated by successful diplomatic arrangements ensuring his security and the strategic importance of his presence at the summit to discuss Ukraine's future and ongoing support from the G7 nations.

Rationale: Given the ongoing war with Russia and the importance of Ukraine in G7 discussions, there is a reasonable likelihood that Zelenskyy will attend in person, provided security and logistics allow it. However, the lack of current confirmation and the potential for unforeseen circumstances make it difficult to predict with certainty. The status quo outcome is "Unknown," but the historical trend of Zelenskyy's involvement in G7 activities suggests a moderate probability of attendance.
