[2025-06-03 08:01:31] INFO: Prediction: 0.9
[2025-06-03 08:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 12 days, as the G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15–17, 2025, and today is June 3, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Donald Trump will attend the G7 Summit in person, as confirmed by multiple reputable sources and official statements from the White House.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected event that prevents Trump from attending in person. This could include a sudden health issue, a significant domestic or international crisis requiring his presence in the U.S., or severe diplomatic tensions escalating to a point where his attendance becomes untenable.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current trajectory, where Trump follows through on the confirmed plans to attend the G7 Summit. He travels to Kananaskis, Alberta, and participates in the summit activities as scheduled, engaging directly with other heads of state.

Rationale: Given the official confirmations and the lack of any current indications that his attendance is in jeopardy, the most likely outcome is that Trump will attend the G7 Summit. The world generally changes slowly, and barring any unforeseen events, the status quo is expected to hold. 

Final answer: "Probability: 90%"

[2025-06-03 08:01:32] INFO: Prediction: 0.9
[2025-06-03 08:01:32] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 12 to 14 days, as the G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that Donald Trump will attend the G7 Summit in person, as confirmed by multiple reputable sources and official statements from the White House.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected event that prevents Trump from attending in person. This could be a sudden health issue, a significant domestic crisis requiring his presence in the U.S., or a major diplomatic incident that leads to a last-minute cancellation of his trip.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current plan, where Donald Trump travels to Canada and participates in the G7 Summit as scheduled. This would involve him being physically present at the summit, engaging directly with other heads of state.

Given the current information and the official confirmations of Trump's attendance, the probability of him attending the G7 Summit in person is high. The status quo strongly supports a Yes outcome, and while unforeseen events could alter this, they are less likely.

Final answer: "Probability: 90%"

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unforeseen event such as a last-minute health issue, a significant diplomatic incident, or a security threat that prevents Donald Trump from attending the summit in person. Additionally, a sudden change in U.S.-Canada relations or domestic political pressures could lead to a cancellation of his trip.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current plan, where Donald Trump travels to Kananaskis, Alberta, and participates in the G7 Summit as scheduled. Given the current confirmations and lack of significant barriers, this scenario is highly likely.

Rationale: Given the current information, official confirmations, and the short time frame until the summit, the probability of Donald Trump attending the G7 Summit in person is high. The status quo strongly supports a Yes outcome, and while unexpected events could occur, they are less likely given the current circumstances and preparations.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that Donald Trump will attend the G7 Summit in person, as currently confirmed by multiple reputable sources and official statements from the White House.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unforeseen event such as a health issue, a significant domestic or international crisis requiring Trump's immediate attention, or a diplomatic incident that leads to a last-minute cancellation of his attendance.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current situation where Donald Trump, as confirmed by official statements, attends the G7 Summit in person, participating in discussions and meeting with other heads of state.

Rationale: Given the official confirmation from the White House and the lack of any current indications of potential disruptions, the probability of Trump attending the summit remains high. The status quo, supported by official announcements and media reports, suggests that he will attend as planned. While unforeseen events could alter this outcome, they are less likely given the short time frame and the current stability of the situation.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Donald Trump will attend the G7 Summit in person, as confirmed by multiple reputable sources and official statements from the White House.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: An unforeseen event, such as a significant health issue, a major domestic or international crisis, or a sudden diplomatic incident, could prevent Donald Trump from attending the G7 Summit in person. Alternatively, a last-minute decision by Trump or his administration to send a representative in his place could also result in a No outcome.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Donald Trump travels to Canada as planned and participates in the G7 Summit, engaging with other heads of state in person as confirmed by the White House and other sources. This scenario aligns with the current status quo and official announcements.

Rationale: Given the official confirmation from the White House and multiple sources, the probability of Trump attending the G7 Summit is high. The status quo strongly suggests a Yes outcome, and while unforeseen events could alter this, they are less likely. Good forecasting practice emphasizes the likelihood of the status quo persisting, as significant changes are relatively rare.
