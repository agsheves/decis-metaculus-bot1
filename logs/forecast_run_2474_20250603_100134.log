[2025-06-03 10:01:50] INFO: Prediction: 0.1
[2025-06-03 10:01:50] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 12 to 14 days, as the G7 Summit is scheduled to take place from June 15 to 17, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the G7 Summit in June 2025. This is based on the current lack of an invitation and the strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is the continuation of the current situation where Canada does not extend an invitation to Prime Minister Modi, and India decides not to pursue attendance due to logistical challenges and ongoing diplomatic tensions.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a significant diplomatic breakthrough between India and Canada, leading to a last-minute invitation being extended to Prime Minister Modi. This could be facilitated by third-party mediation or a shift in priorities for both countries, allowing for Modi's attendance despite the current challenges.

Given the current information and the proximity to the event, the likelihood of a significant change in the status quo is low. The strained diplomatic relations and logistical challenges make a last-minute invitation and acceptance unlikely.

Probability: 10%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the G7 Summit in June 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The current diplomatic tensions between India and Canada remain unresolved, and no invitation is extended to Prime Minister Modi. Even if an invitation is extended at the last minute, India decides not to attend due to logistical challenges and concerns over potential disruptions from separatist groups.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Diplomatic relations between India and Canada improve rapidly, leading to a last-minute invitation being extended to Prime Minister Modi. India manages to overcome logistical challenges and security concerns, allowing Modi to attend the summit in person.

Given the current status of diplomatic relations and the lack of an invitation, the status quo heavily favors a No outcome. The world tends to change slowly, and the strained relations between India and Canada make a last-minute invitation and attendance unlikely. Therefore, the probability of Modi attending the G7 Summit in June 2025 is low.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the situation remaining unchanged, with Canada not extending an invitation to Prime Minister Modi. The existing logistical and diplomatic challenges would prevent any last-minute changes, and Modi would not attend the summit.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a significant diplomatic breakthrough or shift in relations between India and Canada. This could lead to Canada extending a last-minute invitation to Modi, which India accepts. Such a scenario would require overcoming logistical challenges and addressing the concerns of both nations regarding the current diplomatic tensions.

Given the current information and the status quo, the probability that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the G7 Summit in June 2025 is low. The strained diplomatic relations and the absence of an invitation make it unlikely that he will attend.

[2025-06-03 10:01:52] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 12 to 14 days, as the G7 Summit is scheduled to take place from June 15 to 17, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not attend the G7 Summit in June 2025. This is based on the current information that he has not received an invitation and the logistical and diplomatic challenges that would make attending difficult even if an invitation were extended at the last minute.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The Canadian government does not extend an invitation to Prime Minister Modi, and India maintains its stance of not attending the summit due to the strained diplomatic relations and logistical challenges. The summit proceeds without India's participation, and Modi remains in India during the event.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Diplomatic efforts behind the scenes lead to a last-minute invitation being extended to Prime Minister Modi. Despite the logistical challenges and strained relations, India decides to accept the invitation as a gesture of goodwill or due to strategic diplomatic considerations. Modi attends the summit in person, participating alongside other world leaders.

Given the current situation, the status quo outcome is more likely. The diplomatic tensions and lack of an invitation significantly reduce the probability of Modi attending. While last-minute diplomatic resolutions are possible, they are less common, especially given the current strained relations.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is the continuation of the current diplomatic tensions between India and Canada, with no invitation being extended to Prime Minister Modi. Additionally, even if an invitation were extended, logistical challenges and the potential for disruptions from separatist groups could prevent Modi from attending.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a significant diplomatic breakthrough between India and Canada, leading to a last-minute invitation being extended to Prime Minister Modi. This would require rapid resolution of current tensions and effective logistical arrangements to facilitate Modi's attendance at the summit.

Rationale: Given the strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada, the lack of an invitation, and the logistical challenges highlighted, the status quo outcome is that Prime Minister Modi will not attend the G7 Summit. While international diplomacy can sometimes lead to unexpected developments, the likelihood of a sudden resolution and invitation seems low given the current context. Therefore, the probability of Modi attending the summit remains low.

Final answer: "Probability: 10%"
