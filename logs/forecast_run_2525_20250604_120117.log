[2025-06-04 12:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 16 days, as the release date is June 20, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If nothing changed from the current projections, *Elio* would earn between $35 million and $45 million in domestic gross during its opening weekend.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: If the current trend of weak pre-sales and low industry expectations continued, the opening weekend gross would likely remain within the $35 million to $45 million range.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Industry experts and market analysts are expecting *Elio* to have a disappointing opening weekend, with projections consistently falling between $35 million and $45 million.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected scenario leading to a low outcome could involve negative early reviews or poor word-of-mouth spreading just before the release, causing potential audiences to avoid the film, resulting in an opening weekend gross below $35 million.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A high outcome could occur if there is a sudden surge in interest due to a viral marketing campaign or unexpected positive reviews, leading to a significant increase in ticket sales, pushing the opening weekend gross above $45 million.
