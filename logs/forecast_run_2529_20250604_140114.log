[2025-06-04 14:01:30] INFO: Prediction: 0.9
[2025-06-04 14:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 20 days, as the NATO Summit is scheduled to take place from June 24-25, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that Donald Trump will attend the NATO Summit in June 2025. This is based on the current confirmation from the White House and multiple news sources stating that President Trump will be present at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected event or crisis that prevents President Trump from attending the summit in person. This could include a sudden health issue, a significant domestic or international crisis requiring his presence elsewhere, or unforeseen travel complications.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the current status quo where President Trump attends the NATO Summit as planned. This would involve him traveling to The Hague and participating in the summit activities, engaging with other heads of state directly.

Given the current information and the confirmation from reliable sources, the probability of President Trump attending the NATO Summit is high. The status quo suggests that he will attend, and while unforeseen events could alter this outcome, such changes are less likely within the short timeframe remaining.

Final answer: "Probability: 90%"

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: A No outcome could occur if an unexpected event prevents President Trump from attending the summit in person. This could include a sudden health issue, a significant domestic crisis requiring his presence in the United States, or an international incident that leads to a change in travel plans or diplomatic strategy.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A Yes outcome would occur if President Trump follows through with the current plans and attends the NATO Summit in person, as confirmed by the White House and reported by multiple news sources. This would involve him being physically present at the summit in The Hague, engaging directly with other heads of state.

Given the current confirmation and the tendency for the status quo to prevail, the probability of Donald Trump attending the NATO Summit in June 2025 is high. However, considering the potential for unforeseen events, there is still some uncertainty.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Donald Trump will attend the NATO Summit in June 2025. This is based on the current confirmation from the White House and multiple news sources reporting that President Trump will be present at the summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected event or crisis that prevents Trump from attending. This could be a personal health issue, a significant domestic or international crisis requiring his presence in the United States, or a sudden diplomatic incident that leads to a decision not to attend.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that President Trump follows through with the current plan and attends the NATO Summit as scheduled. This scenario is supported by the White House's confirmation and the importance of the topics to be discussed, which align with Trump's known policy interests and objectives.

Given the current confirmation and the importance of the summit, the status quo strongly suggests that Trump will attend. While unforeseen events could change this outcome, they are less likely given the short time frame and the significance of the summit.

[2025-06-04 14:01:31] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 20 to 21 days, as the NATO Summit is scheduled to take place from June 24-25, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that Donald Trump will attend the NATO Summit in June 2025. This is based on the current confirmation from the White House and multiple news sources.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve an unexpected event preventing Donald Trump from attending the summit in person. This could include a sudden health issue, a significant domestic or international crisis requiring his presence elsewhere, or unforeseen travel restrictions or security concerns.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current plan, where Donald Trump travels to The Hague and participates in the NATO Summit as scheduled. This would involve him being present at the summit and engaging with other heads of state in person.

Given the current confirmation from the White House and the lack of any immediate threats or issues that could prevent attendance, the probability of Donald Trump attending the NATO Summit remains high. The status quo strongly suggests a Yes outcome, and while unforeseen events can always occur, they are generally less likely than the planned scenario.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome involves Donald Trump attending the summit as planned, which aligns with the current confirmation from the White House and the reports from news sources. Given the importance of the summit and the topics expected to be discussed, it is likely that he will prioritize attending in person to engage directly with other NATO leaders.

Given the current information and the weight of the status quo, the probability of Donald Trump attending the NATO Summit in June 2025 is high. The confirmation from the White House and consistent reporting from multiple sources support this outcome.
