[2025-06-05 00:03:10] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-06-05 00:03:10] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 21 days, as the third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," since the second estimate shows a negative growth rate of -0.2%.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve continued or worsening economic conditions such as further increases in imports, additional decreases in government spending, or any negative revisions to investment, consumer spending, or exports data that were previously underestimated.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome could involve positive revisions to the data, such as stronger than initially reported consumer spending, investment, or exports, or a downward revision in imports. Additionally, unexpected positive economic developments or data corrections that were not previously accounted for could push the GDP growth rate into positive territory.

Rationale: Given the current status quo of a -0.2% growth rate in the second estimate, the most likely outcome is that the third estimate will remain negative, as significant changes in GDP estimates between the second and third releases are relatively uncommon. While there is a possibility for positive revisions, the historical trend and the nature of GDP revisions suggest that the estimate is more likely to remain negative. Therefore, the probability of a "Yes" outcome is relatively low.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as the second estimate shows a negative growth rate of -0.2%.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the third estimate remaining negative, potentially due to continued or increased imports, further decreases in government spending, or any downward revisions in consumer spending, investment, or exports.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a significant upward revision in the third estimate, possibly due to new data showing stronger-than-expected consumer spending, investment, or exports, or a downward revision in imports or government spending reductions.

Rationale:
Given the current status quo of a -0.2% growth rate in the second estimate, the probability of a shift to a positive growth rate in the third estimate is relatively low. The world tends to change slowly, and significant revisions between the second and third GDP estimates are uncommon unless new, substantial data emerges. The factors contributing to the contraction, such as increased imports and decreased government spending, would need to be offset by significant positive adjustments in other areas to achieve positive growth. While not impossible, such a shift would require notable changes in economic conditions or data collection, which seems unlikely given the current information.

[2025-06-05 00:03:10] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately three weeks, as the third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," as the second estimate shows a negative growth rate of -0.2%.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve the third estimate remaining negative or improving slightly but still below 0.0%. This could happen if the factors contributing to the contraction, such as increased imports and decreased government spending, persist or worsen. Additionally, any revisions to investment, consumer spending, or exports might not be sufficient to push the GDP growth into positive territory.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve a significant upward revision in the third estimate, showing a positive growth rate. This could occur if there are substantial upward adjustments in investment, consumer spending, or exports, or if the impact of imports and government spending is less negative than initially estimated. Additionally, new data or methodological changes could lead to a more favorable revision.

Rationale: Given the current status quo of a -0.2% growth rate in the second estimate, the most likely outcome is that the third estimate will remain negative. While revisions can occur, they typically do not result in drastic changes unless there are significant new data or adjustments. The historical context of previous quarters showing positive growth and the unexpected nature of the contraction suggest some potential for upward revision, but the weight of evidence currently supports a continuation of the negative trend.

Final Answer: Probability: 30%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as the second estimate shows a negative growth rate of -0.2%.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The third estimate continues to reflect negative growth due to persistent negative factors such as high import levels and decreased government spending, which are not sufficiently offset by increases in investment, consumer spending, and exports. Additionally, any unforeseen economic disruptions or negative revisions to data could reinforce the negative growth outcome.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The third estimate revises the growth rate into positive territory due to stronger-than-expected performance in key areas such as consumer spending and exports, or a significant downward revision in import figures. Additionally, any positive revisions to investment data or government spending could contribute to a positive growth rate.

Rationale: Given the current status quo of a -0.2% growth rate and the historical tendency for GDP estimates to undergo only modest revisions between the second and third estimates, the likelihood of the third estimate showing positive growth is relatively low. The factors contributing to the negative growth, such as increased imports and decreased government spending, would need to see significant revisions or offsets to result in a positive growth rate. While there is a possibility for positive revisions, the status quo suggests a continuation of negative growth.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: The third estimate remains negative, potentially due to continued high import levels, further decreases in government spending, or revisions that do not significantly alter the current negative growth trajectory. The adjustments made in the third estimate do not sufficiently account for the positive contributions from investment, consumer spending, and exports to push the GDP growth rate into positive territory.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The third estimate revises the GDP growth rate into positive territory, possibly due to stronger-than-expected revisions in consumer spending, investment, or exports. Additionally, a downward revision in import data or an upward revision in government spending could contribute to a positive growth rate. External factors, such as unexpected economic stimuli or policy changes, could also play a role in improving the GDP estimate.

Rationale: Given the current status quo of a -0.2% growth rate, the probability of a significant revision that would push the GDP into positive territory is relatively low. Historical patterns and the slow nature of economic changes suggest that drastic revisions are uncommon. However, the slight improvement from the advance to the second estimate indicates some potential for further positive adjustments, though not necessarily enough to turn the growth rate positive.
