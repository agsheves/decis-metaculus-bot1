[2025-06-05 06:01:41] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 26 days, from June 5, 2025, to July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," as there are currently no reports or indications of any MEP planning to resign within the specified timeframe.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: No new information or events occur that lead to any MEP announcing their resignation between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025. The current political climate remains stable, and no scandals or personal reasons prompt any MEPs to resign during this period.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A new development, such as a political scandal, personal issue, or pressure from political parties, leads to an MEP announcing their resignation after June 9, 2025, and before July 1, 2025. For instance, the ongoing lobbying scandal related to Huawei could escalate, resulting in an MEP deciding to step down.

Given the historical context and the lack of current indications of impending resignations, the status quo outcome carries significant weight. However, the possibility of unforeseen events, such as the escalation of the lobbying scandal, should not be entirely dismissed.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

[2025-06-05 06:01:41] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately 26 days, from June 5, 2025, to July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No," as there are currently no reports or announcements of any MEP resignations occurring between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: No MEPs announce their resignation between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025. The European Parliament continues its operations without any resignations during this period, and the lobbying scandal does not lead to immediate resignations.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: An MEP involved in the lobbying scandal related to Huawei or another unrelated issue decides to resign and announces their resignation between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025. This could be due to political pressure, personal reasons, or as a result of an investigation.

Given the current lack of information about impending resignations and the historical tendency for such events to be relatively rare, the status quo outcome is more likely. However, the lobbying scandal could potentially trigger unexpected resignations, so it's important to consider that possibility.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

[2025-06-05 06:01:41] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 26 days, from June 5, 2025, to June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as there are currently no reports or announcements of any MEP resigning between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that no MEPs announce their resignation between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025. This could occur if the lobbying scandal does not lead to any immediate consequences for MEPs, or if any potential resignations are delayed until after July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that an MEP announces their resignation between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025, possibly due to the lobbying scandal related to Huawei or other unrelated personal or political reasons.

Rationale: Given the lack of current announcements or indications of impending resignations, the status quo suggests a "No" outcome. However, the presence of a lobbying scandal could increase the likelihood of resignations, particularly if new information emerges or pressure mounts on specific MEPs. Despite this, the probability of a resignation occurring within the specific timeframe remains relatively low, as political processes and decisions often take time to unfold.

[2025-06-05 06:01:42] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 25 days, from June 5, 2025, to June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is "No," as there are currently no reports or announcements of any MEP resignations within the specified timeframe.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would be that no MEPs announce their resignation between June 9, 2025, and June 30, 2025. This could occur if the lobbying scandal does not implicate any MEPs directly, if the scandal does not gain further traction, or if implicated MEPs decide to remain in their positions despite any pressure.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve an MEP announcing their resignation between June 9, 2025, and June 30, 2025. This could happen if the lobbying scandal escalates, implicating one or more MEPs, leading to political pressure or personal decisions to resign. Alternatively, an unrelated issue could prompt an MEP to resign within this timeframe.

Given the status quo and the historical context of MEP resignations, the probability of a resignation occurring within the specified timeframe seems relatively low. However, the presence of the lobbying scandal introduces some uncertainty, which should be considered.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: No members of the European Parliament announce their resignation between June 9, 2025, and July 1, 2025. The current situation remains stable, and no new developments or scandals prompt any MEPs to resign during this period.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025, and before July 1, 2025. This could be triggered by new developments in the lobbying scandal related to Huawei or other unforeseen political, personal, or legal issues affecting an MEP.

Rationale: Given the current information, there is no indication of any impending resignations. The status quo suggests stability, and historically, resignations are not frequent occurrences. However, the ongoing lobbying scandal could potentially lead to unexpected resignations if new information or pressure arises. Despite this possibility, the lack of current indications of resignations suggests that the probability of a resignation occurring within the specified timeframe is relatively low.
