[2025-06-05 14:01:28] INFO: Prediction: 0.85
[2025-06-05 14:01:28] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 26 days, as the resolution will occur on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "Yes," since Wikipedia currently lists X as blocked in all seven specified countries: China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve one or more of the listed countries lifting their bans on X before the resolution date. For instance, if Venezuela decides to lift its ban due to changing political circumstances or international pressure, and this change is reflected on Wikipedia by the resolution date, the outcome would be "No."

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would be the continuation of the current bans in all seven countries, with no changes to the Wikipedia list by the resolution date. Even if new countries like Brazil and Pakistan are added to the list, as long as the original seven countries remain listed, the outcome will be "Yes."

Rationale: Given the short time frame until the resolution date and the historical persistence of these bans, it is likely that the status quo will remain unchanged. Wikipedia's editorial process may not update the list to include new countries like Brazil and Pakistan, but this does not affect the outcome as long as the original seven countries remain listed. Additionally, geopolitical and internal political dynamics in these countries suggest that lifting bans on X is unlikely in the immediate future.

Final Answer: Probability: 85%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is Yes, since Wikipedia currently lists all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) as blocking access to X.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Wikipedia editors updating the page to remove one or more of the listed countries from the "currently blocking" section. This could happen if, for example, diplomatic changes or policy shifts lead to the lifting of bans in one or more of these countries, or if Wikipedia editors determine that the bans are not effectively enforced.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome involves the Wikipedia page remaining unchanged or being updated to include additional countries that have implemented bans, such as Brazil and Pakistan, without removing any of the currently listed countries.

Rationale: Given the short time frame until the resolution date and the fact that Wikipedia already lists these countries as blocking X, the status quo is a strong predictor of the outcome. Wikipedia's editorial process can be slow, and changes to the list would require clear evidence or consensus that the bans have been lifted or are no longer in effect. Additionally, the political climates in these countries suggest that lifting bans on X is unlikely in the immediate future. Therefore, the probability of the outcome being Yes is high.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is Yes, as Wikipedia currently lists all the specified countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) as blocking access to X.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome would involve Wikipedia no longer listing one or more of the specified countries as blocking access to X by July 1, 2025. This could occur if a country lifts its ban or if Wikipedia editors determine that the ban is not effectively enforced and update the page accordingly.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Wikipedia maintaining the current list of countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) as blocking access to X. This could happen if there are no significant changes in the geopolitical landscape or Wikipedia's editorial decisions regarding these countries' bans on X.

Rationale:
Given that the status quo is that Wikipedia currently lists all the specified countries as blocking access to X, and considering the relatively short time frame until the resolution date, it is likely that the list will remain unchanged. Wikipedia's editorial process can be slow, and changes to the list would require reliable sources and consensus among editors. Additionally, the countries in question have historically maintained strict control over internet access, making it less likely for them to lift bans on X in the short term. Therefore, the probability of the status quo outcome (Yes) is higher.

Final Answer: "Probability: 85%"

[2025-06-05 14:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 26 days, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be Yes, because Wikipedia currently lists all the specified countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) as blocking access to X.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve one or more of the listed countries lifting their ban on X before the resolution date. For example, if Venezuela decides to lift its ban following political changes or negotiations with X, and this change is reflected on Wikipedia by the resolution date, the outcome could be No.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is the continuation of the current bans in all seven countries, with no changes in their status or Wikipedia's listing by the resolution date. Additionally, even if new countries like Brazil and Pakistan are added to the list, as long as the original seven countries remain listed, the outcome will be Yes.

Rationale: Given the current status and historical context, the likelihood of all seven countries lifting their bans within the next few weeks is low. Political and regulatory changes typically take time, and the status quo tends to persist. Moreover, Wikipedia's editorial process may not immediately reflect changes, especially if they occur close to the resolution date. Therefore, the probability of the status quo outcome (Yes) is relatively high.

Final Answer: Probability: 85%

[2025-06-05 14:01:30] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately 26 days, as the resolution will occur on or after July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changes, is Yes. As of the latest information, Wikipedia lists China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as countries currently blocking access to X (formerly Twitter).

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Wikipedia editors updating the page to reflect changes in the status of X bans in one or more of the listed countries. For example, if Venezuela lifts its ban or if there is a significant political change in any of the listed countries leading to the unblocking of X, and this is updated on Wikipedia before the resolution date, the outcome could be No.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve the current bans remaining in place and Wikipedia not updating the list to reflect any changes in the status of X bans in the listed countries. This could be due to a lack of significant political changes or developments that would lead to the lifting of bans, or simply due to the editorial process on Wikipedia not updating the page in time.

Rationale: Given the short time frame until the resolution date and the historical tendency for geopolitical situations to change slowly, it is reasonable to put extra weight on the status quo outcome. The countries listed have longstanding issues with censorship and control over internet access, making it less likely for sudden changes to occur. Additionally, Wikipedia's editorial process may not update the page in time to reflect any changes, even if they occur.
