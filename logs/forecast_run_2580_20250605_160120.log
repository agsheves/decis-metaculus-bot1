[2025-06-05 16:01:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 25 days, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there has been no official announcement from the Uruguayan government confirming President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that the Uruguayan government continues to deliberate internally about the benefits and implications of attending the BRICS summit but ultimately decides not to make a public announcement before July 1, 2025. This could be due to political considerations, scheduling conflicts, or strategic diplomatic reasons.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that the Uruguayan government, after further discussions and considerations, decides to publicly announce President Orsi's intention to attend the BRICS summit. This could be driven by a desire to strengthen diplomatic ties with BRICS countries, particularly following the positive interactions with the New Development Bank and the invitation from President Lula.

Rationale: Given the current status quo, the probability leans towards "No" since no announcement has been made yet. However, the positive diplomatic signals and the expressed interest in engaging with BRICS countries suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a "Yes" outcome. The time remaining until the resolution allows for the potential of an announcement, but the tendency of the status quo to persist should be given extra weight.

Probability: 40%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," since there has been no official announcement from the Uruguayan government confirming President Yamandú Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome is that despite the positive diplomatic signals and interest in strengthening ties with BRICS, the Uruguayan government does not issue any public communication confirming President Orsi's attendance before July 1, 2025. This could be due to internal political considerations, logistical issues, or a strategic decision to delay the announcement.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome is that the Uruguayan government, recognizing the strategic importance of the BRICS summit and the potential benefits of attending, issues a public statement or communication confirming President Orsi's attendance before the deadline. This could be driven by further diplomatic engagements, internal consensus, or a finalized decision to enhance Uruguay's international relations with BRICS countries.

Rationale: Given the current status quo and the lack of an official announcement, the probability of a "No" outcome is higher. However, the interest shown by Uruguay in engaging with BRICS and the time remaining until the deadline suggest that there is still a reasonable chance for a "Yes" outcome. The world changes slowly, and official announcements can sometimes be delayed due to various factors. Therefore, while the status quo leans towards "No," the possibility of a "Yes" outcome cannot be ignored.

[2025-06-05 16:01:39] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 26 days, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as there has been no official announcement from the Uruguayan government confirming President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the positive diplomatic signals and interest in strengthening ties with the BRICS, the Uruguayan government decides not to make an official announcement regarding President Orsi's attendance. This could be due to internal political considerations, logistical challenges, or a strategic decision to maintain a neutral stance.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: In the coming weeks, the Uruguayan government decides to officially announce President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. This could be prompted by successful diplomatic negotiations, further encouragement from BRICS member countries, or a strategic decision to enhance Uruguay's international presence and economic opportunities.

Rationale: Given the current information, there is a strong interest from Uruguay in engaging with the BRICS, as evidenced by the invitation from President Lula and the positive remarks from Uruguayan Foreign Minister Mario Lubetkin. Additionally, President Orsi's meeting with Dilma Rousseff and the discussion about joining the BRICS bank suggest a favorable disposition towards participation. However, without an official announcement, the status quo remains "No." The world often changes slowly, and official confirmations can be delayed due to various factors. Nonetheless, the positive diplomatic context and the time remaining until the resolution suggest a reasonable probability that an announcement could still be made.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," since there has been no official announcement from the Uruguayan government confirming President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Despite the positive diplomatic signals and interest in strengthening ties with the BRICS, the Uruguayan government decides not to formally announce President Orsi's attendance at the summit. This could be due to internal political considerations, scheduling conflicts, or a strategic decision to maintain a neutral stance.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: The Uruguayan government, recognizing the potential benefits of participating in the BRICS summit and the opportunity to enhance its international standing, issues an official announcement confirming President Orsi's attendance. This decision could be influenced by further diplomatic engagements, economic incentives, or pressure from domestic stakeholders who favor closer ties with BRICS countries.

Rationale: Given the current information, there is a significant interest from Uruguay in engaging with the BRICS, as evidenced by diplomatic activities and discussions with BRICS representatives. However, the lack of an official announcement at this stage suggests some hesitation or ongoing deliberations within the Uruguayan government. The status quo outcome leans towards "No," but the proximity of the summit and the potential benefits of participation could lead to a last-minute decision to announce attendance. Considering these factors, I will assign a probability that reflects the likelihood of a change in the current situation.

Probability: 60%

This could be prompted by further diplomatic engagements, internal discussions emphasizing the importance of the summit, or a strategic decision to align more closely with BRICS countries.

Rationale: Given the current information, there is a clear interest from Uruguay in engaging with BRICS, as evidenced by the diplomatic interactions and discussions surrounding the New Development Bank. However, the absence of an official announcement at this point suggests some level of hesitation or pending decision-making. The status quo outcome is "No," but the positive diplomatic context and the remaining time before the resolution date suggest a non-negligible probability of a "Yes" outcome. Considering the tendency for the status quo to prevail and the possibility of a last-minute announcement, I would estimate the probability of a "Yes" outcome to be slightly below even odds.
