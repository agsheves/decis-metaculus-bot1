[2025-06-05 18:56:22] INFO: Prediction: 0.25
[2025-06-05 18:56:22] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 26 days, as today is June 5, 2025, and the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "No," as Francis Suarez has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome: Francis Suarez decides not to run for governor due to the significant challenge posed by President Trump's endorsement of Rep. Byron Donalds. Suarez may choose to explore other political or professional opportunities instead, especially given his term-limited status as Miami mayor.

(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Despite the challenges, Suarez decides to announce his candidacy for Florida governor before the July 1, 2025, deadline. He may believe that his political experience and appeal in Miami could help him overcome the endorsement of Rep. Byron Donalds and make a competitive bid for the governorship.

Rationale: Given the current status quo, where Suarez has not announced his candidacy and the significant influence of Trump's endorsement, the likelihood of a "No" outcome is higher. While Suarez has expressed interest, the political landscape and the short time frame make an official announcement less probable. However, the situation remains fluid, and a last-minute decision is still possible, albeit less likely.

Final answer: "Probability: 25%"

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as Francis Suarez has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Francis Suarez decides not to run for governor due to the significant impact of President Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds. He may choose to explore other political opportunities or roles that align with his career goals, especially given his term-limited status as Miami mayor.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Despite the challenges posed by Trump's endorsement, Suarez might see a strategic opportunity or receive encouragement from key political allies or constituents to announce his candidacy. He could decide that the potential benefits of running outweigh the risks, leading him to make an official announcement before the July 1 deadline.

Given the current information, the status quo outcome leans towards a "No" resolution. Suarez has expressed interest but has not made any official moves, and the endorsement of a strong candidate by a prominent figure like Trump complicates his potential candidacy. While the situation remains fluid, the likelihood of a sudden announcement seems lower given the short time frame and existing political dynamics.

Probability: 25%

[2025-06-05 18:56:23] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 25 days, as today is June 5, 2025, and the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as Francis Suarez has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Francis Suarez continues to express interest in the gubernatorial race but ultimately decides not to announce his candidacy before July 1, 2025. This decision could be influenced by the strong endorsement of Byron Donalds by President Trump, which Suarez has acknowledged as a significant factor. Suarez might choose to explore other political opportunities or roles that do not involve running for governor at this time.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Despite the challenges posed by Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds, Suarez decides to announce his candidacy for Florida governor before the July 1, 2025 deadline. This decision could be driven by a strategic calculation that his unique position and platform as Miami's mayor could still resonate with a significant portion of the Republican electorate, or by a change in the political landscape that makes his candidacy more viable.

Rationale: Given the current status quo and the factors at play, the probability of Suarez announcing his candidacy is relatively low. The endorsement of Byron Donalds by Trump is a significant hurdle, and Suarez has acknowledged its impact. Additionally, Suarez's pattern of expressing interest without committing suggests a cautious approach. However, the short time frame remaining and his continued public interest introduce some uncertainty.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Francis Suarez continues to express interest in running for governor but ultimately decides not to announce his candidacy before the July 1, 2025, deadline. This decision could be influenced by factors such as the strong endorsement of Byron Donalds by President Trump, which makes it challenging for Suarez to gain traction within the Republican Party. Additionally, Suarez might choose to explore other political or public service opportunities that do not involve running for governor at this time.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Francis Suarez decides to announce his candidacy for Florida governor before the July 1, 2025, deadline. This could occur if he perceives a shift in the political landscape that makes his candidacy more viable, such as a weakening of Byron Donalds' position or increased support from influential Republican figures or donors. Suarez might also be motivated by a strong desire to continue his political career after being term-limited as Miami mayor.

Given the current status quo and the factors at play, the probability of Suarez announcing his candidacy before the deadline seems relatively low. The endorsement of Byron Donalds by President Trump is a significant hurdle, and Suarez has acknowledged its impact. While Suarez has expressed interest, the lack of an announcement thus far suggests a cautious approach.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No," as Francis Suarez has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: Francis Suarez continues to express interest in the gubernatorial race but ultimately decides not to run due to the challenges posed by President Trump's endorsement of Rep. Byron Donalds. Suarez may choose to explore other political opportunities or roles outside of running for governor, especially given the limited time frame and the potential difficulty in building a competitive campaign against a Trump-endorsed candidate.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: Despite the challenges, Suarez decides to announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025. This could happen if he perceives a strategic advantage or opportunity that outweighs the potential difficulties, such as a shift in the political landscape, gaining significant support from influential backers, or identifying a unique platform that resonates with voters.

Rationale: Given the current status and the factors at play, the status quo outcome of "No" seems more likely. Suarez has expressed interest but has not made a definitive move, and the endorsement of a strong candidate by a prominent figure like Trump presents a significant hurdle. Additionally, with less than a month remaining, the likelihood of a sudden announcement decreases as time passes. However, the situation remains fluid, and political dynamics can change rapidly.
