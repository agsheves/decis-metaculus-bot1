[2025-06-06 04:05:10] INFO: Prediction: 0.2
[2025-06-06 04:05:10] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 24 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is June 6, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as John Morgan has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: John Morgan continues to express interest in the governor's race but ultimately decides not to run due to the logistical challenges of forming a new political party, the current field of candidates, or personal reasons such as his semi-retired status and time spent in Hawaii.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: John Morgan decides to announce his candidacy within the next few weeks, possibly motivated by dissatisfaction with the current candidates or a strategic decision to capitalize on media attention and public interest in a third-party run.

Rationale: Given the current information, the status quo outcome is more likely, as John Morgan has not yet made a formal announcement and faces significant logistical hurdles if he intends to run under a new party. Additionally, his semi-retired status and time spent in Hawaii suggest he may not be fully committed to a campaign. However, the possibility remains that he could announce his candidacy if he sees a strategic advantage or feels compelled to enter the race due to dissatisfaction with the current political landscape. Considering the slow pace of change and the weight of the status quo, the probability of a Yes outcome is relatively low.

Final answer: "Probability: 20%"

[2025-06-06 04:05:10] INFO: Prediction: 0.3
[2025-06-06 04:05:10] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 25 days, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is June 6, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is **No**, as John Morgan has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: John Morgan continues to express dissatisfaction with both major parties and the current political landscape in Florida but ultimately decides not to run for governor. He may choose to focus on other endeavors, such as his legal practice or advocacy work, or he may find the logistical challenges of forming a new political party too daunting within the given timeframe.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: John Morgan decides to capitalize on the current political climate and his public dissatisfaction with both parties by announcing his candidacy for governor. He successfully navigates the logistical challenges of forming a new political party or decides to run as an independent or under an existing minor party. His announcement comes before the July 1, 2025, deadline.

Rationale: Given the limited time remaining, the status quo outcome is more likely. Morgan has expressed uncertainty and has not taken definitive steps toward candidacy, such as forming a new party or making a formal announcement. Additionally, his semi-retired status and significant time spent in Hawaii suggest he may not be fully committed to a gubernatorial campaign. However, his public appearances and discussions about running indicate he is still considering it, leaving a non-zero probability for a Yes outcome.

Probability: 30%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as John Morgan has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: John Morgan continues to express interest in running but ultimately decides against it due to the logistical challenges of forming a new political party within the tight deadline. Additionally, he may choose to remain semi-retired and focus on his personal life in Hawaii, rather than committing to a gubernatorial campaign.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: John Morgan decides to enter the race, motivated by dissatisfaction with the current political landscape and a desire to address issues like economic inequality. He successfully forms a new political party or decides to run as an independent, and makes a formal announcement of his candidacy before the July 1, 2025, deadline.

Rationale: Given the current status, the likelihood of John Morgan announcing his candidacy seems low. He has expressed interest but has not taken definitive steps toward running, and the deadline for forming a new political party is approaching quickly. Additionally, his semi-retired status and residence in Hawaii suggest he may not be fully committed to a campaign. The status quo outcome is a strong indicator, as significant changes in political decisions often require more time and preparation than the remaining 25 days allow.

[2025-06-06 04:05:10] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is just under a month, as the deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is June 6, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be **No**, as John Morgan has not yet announced his candidacy for Florida governor.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: John Morgan continues to express dissatisfaction with the current political landscape but ultimately decides not to run for governor. He may choose to focus on his personal life, business interests, or other forms of advocacy, such as supporting a third-party movement without being a candidate himself. Additionally, the logistical challenges of forming a new political party and qualifying for the ballot could deter him from entering the race.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: John Morgan decides to announce his candidacy for Florida governor within the next few weeks. He may be motivated by a perceived lack of viable candidates addressing the issues he cares about, such as economic inequality and the influence of special interests. He could also see an opportunity to galvanize support for a new political party, leveraging his public profile and resources to mount a credible campaign.

Rationale: Given the short time frame remaining and Morgan's current indecision, the status quo outcome of **No** carries significant weight. The logistical challenges and his semi-retired lifestyle suggest he may not be fully committed to a campaign. However, his public flirtation with the idea and dissatisfaction with the current political environment leave open the possibility of a late decision to run.

Final Answer: "Probability: 25%"

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: John Morgan continues to express his dissatisfaction with both major parties and the current political landscape but ultimately decides not to run for governor. He may choose to focus on his personal life, business interests, or other forms of advocacy instead of pursuing a political campaign. Additionally, the logistical challenges of forming a new political party and qualifying for the ballot may deter him from entering the race.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: John Morgan decides to capitalize on his public profile and dissatisfaction with the current political environment by formally announcing his candidacy for Florida governor. He may see an opportunity to leverage his wealth and influence to create a new political party or run as an independent, especially if he perceives a lack of compelling candidates in the existing field. The urgency of the approaching deadline could prompt him to make a decision and announcement before July 1, 2025.

Rationale: Given the current information, John Morgan has not yet announced his candidacy, and the deadline is approaching quickly. While he has expressed interest and dissatisfaction with the political status quo, the logistical challenges and his semi-retired lifestyle suggest a lower likelihood of a sudden announcement. The status quo outcome carries significant weight, as the world tends to change slowly, and there is no strong indication that Morgan is on the verge of making a formal announcement.
