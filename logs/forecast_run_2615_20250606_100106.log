[2025-06-06 10:01:24] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 25 days, as today is June 6, 2025, and the deadline is July 1, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No," as Sudan is currently embroiled in a severe internal conflict with no functioning unified government, making it unlikely that the country would ratify the AfCFTA agreement in the remaining time.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome is the continuation of the current civil conflict and political instability in Sudan. The ongoing power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), along with the fragmentation of civilian alliances, would prevent any cohesive governmental action, including the ratification of international agreements like the AfCFTA.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome would require a rapid and unexpected resolution to the internal conflict, leading to the establishment of a unified and stable government capable of making and executing international agreements. This would also necessitate a prioritization of economic and trade issues, including the ratification of the AfCFTA, within the short time frame remaining.

Given the current situation and the limited time left, the probability of Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is very low. The status quo of ongoing conflict and political instability heavily influences the likelihood of a "No" outcome.

Probability: 5%

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be "No." Sudan is currently embroiled in a severe internal conflict, with fragmented governance and competing power centers, making it unlikely that the country would prioritize or be able to ratify the AfCFTA agreement.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome would involve the continuation of the current civil conflict and political instability in Sudan. The ongoing military confrontations, lack of a unified government, and focus on internal power struggles would prevent any meaningful progress toward ratifying international agreements like the AfCFTA. The humanitarian crisis and governance challenges would likely take precedence over trade agreements.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome would require a rapid and unexpected resolution to the internal conflict, leading to the establishment of a stable and unified government in Sudan. This new government would need to prioritize international trade agreements and quickly move to ratify the AfCFTA before the deadline. Such a scenario would likely involve significant international mediation and support to stabilize the country and facilitate the ratification process.

Given the current state of affairs in Sudan and the short time frame remaining, the likelihood of a "Yes" outcome is very low. The status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome due to the ongoing conflict and governance issues.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, is that Sudan will not ratify the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025. This is due to the ongoing internal conflict, political instability, and lack of a unified government capable of making such international commitments.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues to escalate, leading to further fragmentation of the country. The competing declarations to form separate governments exacerbate the situation, making it impossible for any unified governmental action, including the ratification of international agreements like the AfCFTA. The focus remains on addressing the humanitarian crisis and power struggles rather than international trade agreements.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A sudden and unexpected resolution to the conflict occurs, perhaps through international mediation or a peace agreement between the SAF and RSF. This leads to the formation of a transitional government that prioritizes economic recovery and international cooperation. In a bid to stabilize the economy and gain international support, the new government fast-tracks the ratification of the AfCFTA before the deadline.

Given the current situation and the short time frame remaining, the likelihood of a significant change leading to a Yes outcome is very low. The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome due to the entrenched conflict and political instability.

The ongoing military confrontations, territorial battles, and fragmented governance structures would prevent any meaningful progress toward ratifying international agreements like the AfCFTA. The focus would remain on internal power struggles and humanitarian issues rather than international trade agreements.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would require a significant and rapid change in Sudan's political situation. This could involve a sudden ceasefire or peace agreement between the conflicting parties, leading to the establishment of a unified government capable of making international commitments. Additionally, there would need to be a concerted effort by the international community to facilitate and expedite Sudan's ratification of the AfCFTA, possibly through diplomatic pressure or incentives.

Given the current situation and the limited time remaining, the probability of Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is low. The status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome due to the entrenched conflict and lack of a unified government.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "No." Given the current situation in Sudan, with ongoing civil conflict, political instability, and lack of a unified government, it is highly unlikely that Sudan will ratify the AfCFTA agreement before the deadline.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome: The ongoing civil conflict in Sudan continues without resolution, and the political situation remains unstable. The competing power centers, namely the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), fail to reach any form of agreement or ceasefire. The lack of a functioning government and the focus on internal strife prevent any progress on international agreements, including the AfCFTA. As a result, Sudan does not ratify the agreement before July 1, 2025.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome: A sudden and unexpected breakthrough occurs in the peace process, leading to a temporary ceasefire or agreement between the SAF and RSF. This breakthrough allows for the formation of a provisional government or a unified authority that prioritizes international diplomacy and economic recovery. In a bid to signal stability and commitment to regional cooperation, the new government swiftly moves to ratify the AfCFTA agreement before the deadline.

Rationale: The status quo heavily favors a "No" outcome due to the severe internal conflict and political fragmentation in Sudan. The likelihood of a rapid resolution to these issues and the subsequent ratification of the AfCFTA within the remaining 25 days is extremely low. Historical patterns suggest that significant political and diplomatic changes, especially in conflict-ridden regions, tend to occur slowly and require extensive negotiation and stabilization efforts. Therefore, the probability of Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, remains minimal.

Final answer: "Probability: 5%"
