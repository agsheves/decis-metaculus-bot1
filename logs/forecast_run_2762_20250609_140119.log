[2025-06-09 14:01:46] INFO: Prediction: 0.7
[2025-06-09 14:01:46] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two weeks, as the Democratic primary for New York City mayor is scheduled for June 24, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be a "Yes" resolution. Andrew Cuomo currently leads in both first-choice votes and the final ranked-choice tally according to the latest polling data.

(c) A scenario that results in a "No" outcome could involve Zohran Mamdani continuing his momentum and gaining enough first-choice votes and second-choice support to surpass Cuomo in the ranked-choice voting rounds. This could be facilitated by further endorsements, effective campaign strategies targeting undecided voters, or any negative developments in Cuomo's campaign that erode his support.

(d) A scenario that results in a "Yes" outcome would involve Andrew Cuomo maintaining or expanding his lead in the polls. This could occur if he successfully consolidates his support base, particularly among Black voters, older voters, and women, and if Mamdani's momentum stalls or fails to translate into enough additional first-choice votes.

Given the current polling data and the tendency for the status quo to persist, it is reasonable to assign a higher probability to Cuomo winning the primary. However, Mamdani's rapid rise and the dynamics of ranked-choice voting introduce some uncertainty.

Probability: 70%

[2025-06-09 14:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately two weeks, as the primary is scheduled for June 24, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome, if nothing changed, would be a Yes. Andrew Cuomo is currently leading in both first-choice votes and the final ranked-choice tally according to the latest polling data.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Zohran Mamdani continuing his upward trajectory in the polls, gaining more first-choice support, and further consolidating second-choice votes. If Mamdani's momentum continues and he surpasses Cuomo in the ranked-choice voting process, he could become the presumptive nominee.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Andrew Cuomo maintaining or expanding his current lead in the polls. This could be achieved through continued strong support from key demographics, effective campaigning, and potentially securing more endorsements that sway undecided voters or those considering Mamdani.

Rationale: Given the current polling data, Cuomo is the frontrunner, and the status quo suggests he would win if the election were held today. However, the dynamics of the race, particularly Mamdani's momentum and second-choice appeal, introduce uncertainty. Despite this, changes in political races often occur gradually, and the lead Cuomo holds is significant enough to give him an advantage. Therefore, while acknowledging the potential for shifts, the probability should lean towards the status quo outcome.

Probability: 65%

[2025-06-09 14:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 15 days, as the Democratic primary for New York City mayor is scheduled for June 24, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a "Yes" resolution, as Andrew Cuomo is currently leading both in first-choice votes and in the final ranked-choice tally according to the latest polling data.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Zohran Mamdani continuing his rapid rise in support, particularly by consolidating second-choice votes and gaining additional endorsements. If Mamdani's momentum continues and he surpasses Cuomo in the ranked-choice voting rounds, he could become the presumptive nominee.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Andrew Cuomo maintaining or increasing his lead in the polls, particularly by solidifying his support among key demographics such as Black voters, older voters, and women. Additionally, if Mamdani's momentum stalls or if Cuomo receives further endorsements that bolster his campaign, he would likely secure the nomination.

Rationale: Given the current polling data and the dynamics of the race, Andrew Cuomo is the frontrunner. While Mamdani's surge introduces uncertainty, the status quo favors Cuomo. Historically, frontrunners with a significant lead in both first-choice and ranked-choice scenarios tend to maintain their position unless there is a significant shift in voter sentiment or campaign dynamics. With only two weeks remaining, the likelihood of a dramatic change is reduced, although not impossible. Therefore, the probability of Cuomo winning remains relatively high.

Final answer: "Probability: 70%"

[2025-06-09 14:01:47] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately two weeks, as the primary is scheduled for June 24, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be a "Yes" resolution, as Andrew Cuomo currently leads both in first-choice votes and in the final ranked-choice tally according to the latest polling data.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Zohran Mamdani continuing to gain momentum and increasing his support among undecided voters and those who currently list him as their second choice. If Mamdani manages to secure additional endorsements, particularly from influential figures or organizations, and if he successfully mobilizes younger and more progressive voters, he could potentially overtake Cuomo in the ranked-choice voting rounds.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Andrew Cuomo maintaining or increasing his current lead in the polls. This could be achieved through continued strong support from key demographic groups, such as Black voters and those over 50, as well as securing additional endorsements from influential political figures. If Cuomo effectively addresses any criticisms and capitalizes on his experience and name recognition, he could solidify his position as the presumptive nominee.

Rationale: Given the current polling data and the fact that Cuomo is leading in both first-choice and ranked-choice simulations, the status quo suggests a higher probability of a Yes outcome. While Mamdani's surge introduces uncertainty, the time remaining until the primary is relatively short, and significant changes in voter sentiment typically require more time. Therefore, the likelihood of a dramatic shift in the race is lower, though not impossible.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is that Andrew Cuomo would win the Democratic primary for New York City mayor. He currently leads in both first-choice votes and in the final ranked-choice tally, according to the latest polling data.

(c) A scenario that results in a No outcome could involve Zohran Mamdani continuing his rapid rise in support, particularly among undecided voters and those who currently list him as their second choice. If Mamdani's momentum accelerates and he gains enough first-choice votes or consolidates second-choice votes from eliminated candidates, he could surpass Cuomo in the ranked-choice voting rounds.

(d) A scenario that results in a Yes outcome would involve Andrew Cuomo maintaining or slightly increasing his lead over the next two weeks. This could happen if he secures additional endorsements, effectively counters Mamdani's momentum, or if the distribution of second-choice votes from eliminated candidates favors him more than expected.

Rationale: Given the current polling data, Andrew Cuomo is in a strong position to win the primary. While Mamdani's rise introduces uncertainty, the status quo favors Cuomo. Historically, frontrunners in such positions tend to maintain their lead unless there is a significant shift in voter sentiment or campaign dynamics. The short time frame until the primary also limits the extent of potential changes.
