[2025-06-14 12:01:35] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 16 days, as today is June 14, 2025, and the month ends on June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "One," as only one Level 4 advisory for Iraq has been issued in June 2025 so far.

(c) An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a sudden escalation in geopolitical tensions or security threats in other regions, leading to the issuance of additional Level 4 advisories. For example, if a major conflict or natural disaster were to occur in another country, the State Department might issue a new Level 4 advisory for that country before the end of June.

Rationale:
1. The status quo outcome is "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued so far, and the world tends to change slowly most of the time. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign the highest probability to this outcome.
2. The possibility of no additional advisories being issued (resulting in "One") is quite high, given that there are only 16 days left in the month and no indications of imminent new advisories.
3. However, the State Department could issue additional advisories if new threats emerge, so some probability should be assigned to "Two" and "Three or more" to account for unexpected developments.
4. The probability of "Zero" is very low since at least one advisory has already been issued.

Final probabilities:
Zero: 1%
One: 80%
Two: 15%
Three or more: 4%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued for Iraq in June 2025 so far.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflict or a significant security event in one or more countries, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue additional Level 4 advisories. For example, if a new conflict arises or existing tensions escalate in another region, the State Department might issue one or more Level 4 advisories before the end of June.

Rationale:
1. The status quo outcome is "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued so far this month. Given the historical pattern of travel advisories and the fact that the State Department tends to issue these advisories based on significant changes in security conditions, it is reasonable to place the highest probability on this outcome.
   
2. However, the world is unpredictable, and unforeseen events could lead to additional advisories. Therefore, it is prudent to allocate some probability to the "Two" and "Three or more" options, acknowledging the potential for unexpected developments.

3. The probability of "Zero" is very low, as one advisory has already been issued.

Final probabilities:
Zero: 1%
One: 80%
Two: 15%
Three or more: 4%

[2025-06-14 12:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 16 days, as today is June 14, 2025, and the month ends on June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed would be "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued for Iraq in June 2025 so far.

(c) An unexpected outcome could occur if there is a sudden escalation in geopolitical tensions or a significant security event in multiple countries, leading to the issuance of additional Level 4 advisories. For instance, if a neighboring country to Iraq experiences a similar security threat or if a natural disaster or political upheaval occurs in another region, the State Department might issue new advisories.

Rationale:
1. The status quo outcome is "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued so far. Given that the world tends to change slowly, this outcome should be given extra weight.
2. However, there is still a possibility of unexpected events occurring in the remaining 16 days of June. The State Department could issue additional advisories if new threats emerge or existing situations deteriorate.
3. While it is unlikely that no advisories will be issued (since one has already been issued), there is a possibility of more advisories being issued, though it is uncertain how many.
4. Therefore, while the status quo outcome is most probable, some moderate probability should be assigned to the possibility of two or more advisories being issued.

Final probabilities:
Zero: 0%
One: 70%
Two: 20%
Three or more: 10%

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "One," as there has been one Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory issued for Iraq in June 2025 so far.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflicts or security threats in multiple regions, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue additional Level 4 advisories. For example, if a neighboring country to Iraq experiences a significant deterioration in security conditions, it might also receive a Level 4 advisory. Additionally, unforeseen geopolitical events or natural disasters in other parts of the world could lead to new advisories being issued.

Rationale:
1. The status quo outcome is "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued so far in June 2025. Given the historical pattern of travel advisories and the fact that the world generally changes slowly, this outcome should be given significant weight.

2. However, there are still 16 days left in the month, and the State Department could issue additional advisories if new threats emerge. Therefore, it's prudent to assign some probability to the "Two" and "Three or more" options to account for potential developments.

3. The "Zero" option is highly unlikely, as there is already one confirmed advisory for June 2025. Therefore, this option should have a very low probability.

Final probabilities:
Option_Zero: 1%
Option_One: 75%
Option_Two: 15%

[2025-06-14 12:01:37] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 16 days, as today is June 14, 2025, and the month ends on June 30, 2025.

(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed is "One," as only one Level 4 advisory has been issued for Iraq in June 2025 so far.

(c) A scenario that results in an unexpected outcome could involve a sudden escalation of conflict or a significant security incident in another country, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue additional Level 4 advisories before the end of June. For example, if a neighboring country to Iraq experiences a rapid deterioration in security conditions, it might also receive a Level 4 advisory.

Rationale:
1. **Status Quo Weight**: The current situation indicates that only one Level 4 advisory has been issued so far in June 2025. Given that the world often changes slowly and the State Department typically issues advisories based on significant changes in security conditions, the status quo outcome of "One" is the most likely scenario.

2. **Possibility of Change**: While the status quo is the most likely outcome, there is still a possibility that additional advisories could be issued. The State Department continuously monitors global security situations, and unforeseen events could lead to new advisories.

3. **Unexpected Outcomes**: Although unlikely, there is always a chance of unexpected geopolitical developments that could lead to multiple new advisories. However, given the current information, this scenario is less probable.

Final probabilities:
- Zero: 5% (unlikely given that one advisory is already confirmed)
- One: 70% (most likely based on current information and the status quo)
- Two: 15% (possible if another advisory is issued)
- Three or more: 10% (less likely but accounts for unforeseen significant events)
