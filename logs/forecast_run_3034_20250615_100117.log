[2025-06-15 10:01:36] INFO: Prediction: [Percentile(value=-28.5, percentile=0.1), Percentile(value=-28.0, percentile=0.2), Percentile(value=-27.5, percentile=0.4), Percentile(value=-27.0, percentile=0.6), Percentile(value=-26.5, percentile=0.8), Percentile(value=-26.0, percentile=0.9)]
[2025-06-15 10:01:36] INFO: Reasoning: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:  
There are 15 days left until the U.S. International Investment Position for Q1 2025 is released on June 30, 2025.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:  
If nothing changed from the end of 2024, the U.S. NIIP would remain at –$26.23 trillion.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:  
The U.S. NIIP deteriorated by $6.38 trillion from the end of 2023 to the end of 2024. If this trend continued linearly, the NIIP could worsen by approximately $1.595 trillion per quarter. Therefore, the NIIP for Q1 2025 could be around –$27.825 trillion.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts and markets expect the NIIP to remain highly negative, with a continued deterioration due to ongoing trends such as U.S. equities outperforming foreign equities, which increases U.S. liabilities more than assets. There is no strong indication of a reversal in the trend.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:  
A significant global economic downturn could lead to a sharp decline in U.S. stock prices relative to foreign stocks, reducing U.S. liabilities and improving the NIIP unexpectedly.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:  
A sudden and substantial appreciation of the U.S. dollar could increase the value of U.S. liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, leading to a more negative NIIP than anticipated.
